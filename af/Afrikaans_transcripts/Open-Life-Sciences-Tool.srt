1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,650
Unknown: This is the point of
this presentations is to think

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,250
about kind of tools that you
have to increase participation

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,220
in your projects. And the best
way to increase participation is

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,750
to remove barriers to
participation. And so there's

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,000
this prompt in the slides, which
I really like to what will your

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,720
participation do for your
contributed, it's very tempting

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,660
to think about what are the what
are the contributors going to do

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,770
for me, but it's actually an
easier and more effective way of

9
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,460
working to think about what you
are in control of and what you

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,630
are able to deliver if you're
contributing. So open leaders

11
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:46,770
design and build projects that
empower others to collaborate

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,680
within an inclusive community.
That's what we're all working

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,130
towards over this training
program. And the goal is not to

14
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,840
ask what they can do for you,
but more to ask what I or what

15
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,220
we in the leadership can do for
them. And the reason that I

16
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:11,250
picked this this picture is, I
love thinking about the emergent

17
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,850
properties of a system. So these
are a bunch of ants, and they're

18
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,180
all working together. And each
individual land is not

19
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,780
particularly strong, but
together in when they are

20
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,740
coordinated, they are really,
really powerful. And I think

21
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,340
that's what I find really
exciting about an open and

22
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,590
inclusive collaboration. So this
is I'm sure you've seen this in

23
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,740
lots and lots of your talks for
the open leadership framework.

24
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,820
This is just sort of focusing
for you on the top right corner,

25
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,720
focusing on participation and
inclusion. Thinking about those

26
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,650
community interactions and
thinking about the governance

27
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,860
governance is one of the things
that people generally shy away

28
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,090
from, because they think that
the adults in the room will make

29
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,570
the decisions. And actually you
as the leader, even if there's

30
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,250
like literally nobody else in
your community yet, you are now

31
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,180
the head of that community and
you are in charge of decision

32
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,540
making. You're in charge of
delegating and devolving some of

33
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,650
those responsibilities, and you
are managing that governance.

34
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,460
And it's quite an uncomfortable
space to step into. But it's

35
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,620
extremely powerful, and very,
very rewarding when you do.

36
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:32,130
And it was a nice, concrete,
really fun exercise. And

37
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,850
potentially a really fun
exercise to just sort of have

38
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,820
conversations with people, as
you're talking about your

39
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:44,280
project is a description of an
imaginary person, who might be a

40
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,610
member of your community, they
might be users, they might be

41
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,060
contributors, they might be
funders, this all of those

42
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,140
different people that sort of
enable your community in your

43
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:00,240
project to thrive. And they
recommend that it's not a real

44
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,690
person, it gets a little bit too
sort of personal to have like,

45
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,830
lots of conversations about
specific individuals, but you

46
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:13,290
can absolutely use conversations
with real individuals to inspire

47
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:19,200
a general persona. Now, that is
not to say that your personas

48
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,910
should be general, it's actually
very powerful to draw a specific

49
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,270
and in this case, obviously,
literally draw but and then draw

50
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:32,100
in a figurative sense, specific
imagined people. So you've got

51
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,690
cat and Tom, here in the
examples, put a name on there,

52
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,970
because it just makes them a
little bit more human little bit

53
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,470
more relatable, give them an
age, give them an ethnicity,

54
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,700
give them a job, or maybe other
responsibilities. Give them some

55
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,250
skills, a level of knowledge,
think about what their

56
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,530
background has been. And once
you've done that, think about

57
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,790
their needs, their motivations
and their barriers. And you're

58
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,930
really trying to consider this
person as as a whole and multi

59
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,220
dimensional persona. So you're
not just dreaming up. Somebody

60
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,370
who's going to come along and
format your website, you're

61
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,360
thinking about a whole person
who may happen to have some

62
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,420
skills or be interested in
developing skills to for

63
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:23,460
example, format your website,
and what can you give to them

64
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:29,010
that is beneficial. So just as
some examples here, you've got

65
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:33,210
cast, who is an undergraduate,
an intern is really interested

66
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,920
in science, and he doesn't have
very much money. And Tom is 50

67
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,090
years old. He's a humanitarian.
He has a PhD. He has nine cats.

68
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,120
And he's got more of a
difficulty around time

69
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,760
constraints. And so the the
question the exercises, how can

70
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,800
they be part of your project? So
this is an example persona. I'm

71
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,290
not going to read through it
because you have the slides for

72
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,760
yourself but this is an example
Of how long the persona might be

73
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,470
to three paragraphs, something
like that. And I have to say,

74
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,110
one of the difficulties that I
find with writing personas is

75
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,770
that I tend to just write about
myself. So this slight line at

76
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,890
the bottom of cat also suffers
from a lack of self esteem,

77
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,850
essentially, like every persona
that I come up with says, she

78
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,090
doesn't feel like she has enough
knowledge to contribute or

79
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,260
something along those lines, is
very helpful to actually engage

80
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:32,700
a diverse and inclusive group of
people in helping you build the

81
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,880
personas in the first place.
Otherwise, you will continue to

82
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,760
just manifest like, different
versions of you with different

83
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:44,910
names. And so how are people
getting to join your open

84
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:50,550
project, and the personas are
fun, they're pretty interesting.

85
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,960
The pathways are the real sort
of powerhouse. So you need the

86
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,950
persona, in order to think about
the journey that people will

87
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:04,260
take to contribute to the
project. And I love this picture

88
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:09,570
of it is your responsibility, in
my opinion, as the leader of the

89
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:14,430
project to remove the barriers
to make it a nice, clear, easy

90
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,380
path, the cat can walk along.

91
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,800
So this is sort of going back to
thinking about that mountain of

92
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,460
engagement that malvika was
talking about, somebody has to

93
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,490
discover that your project
exists in the first place. So

94
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,180
how are they going to do that,
then they will come into contact

95
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,020
with it in some way they might
see you give a talk, they might

96
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,230
hear about it on social media,
they might have somebody else

97
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,860
reach out to them, what does
that look like, then they might

98
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,390
participate, hopefully, some of
them will participate. Sustained

99
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,270
participation means that they
keep coming back, they keep

100
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,140
participate. Network
participation means that they

101
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,590
are starting to bring in other
people and they're starting to

102
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:05,340
bring in other sort of linked up
projects, resources and other

103
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,520
communities that you start to
kind of link everyone together.

104
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,210
And then leadership is really
have sort of being part of that

105
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,640
kind of holding that
responsibility for the health of

106
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:21,150
the community. And, and thinking
about directing the ship as it

107
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:26,310
goes forwards. And here's just
an example of a pathway for cat.

108
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,030
So she might see a tweet about
Brazil as festival, buy a ticket

109
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:35,490
and take part in a training
program, turn up to a hackathon.

110
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,970
There'll be afterwards, right?
So if she hosted her first

111
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:43,890
Mozilla sprint hackathon, the
very discovery point, well, that

112
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,440
doesn't make sense, because she
can't discover on that level,

113
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,980
but she could potentially
participate first. And so you're

114
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,680
thinking about what each of
these levels means for this

115
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,180
individual person. And their
leadership is starting to go

116
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:02,400
into that, that mentorship and
that support and role. Now, I've

117
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,120
taken just two slides, I think
from another slide deck, which

118
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,600
is available for you to look at,
because I I probably have gone

119
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,820
over time already. And there are
lots of different ideas for ways

120
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,430
of people to come in. And I
think the best thing that you

121
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,730
can do is you can just ask
people, why they contribute to

122
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,610
other projects, or why they
don't contribute to other

123
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:27,300
projects, what their challenges
are, but mentored issues as a

124
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,160
really, really nice way of
getting started. So writing an

125
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,660
issue on GitHub should be a good
first issue or an issue that is

126
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:40,740
reserved for first timers should
take longer to write than it

127
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,160
would do for you to address. And
that feels really

128
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,400
counterintuitive, unless you
start to think about this, Pat

129
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,870
these pathways in this mountain
of engagement. So if you spend

130
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:58,830
time writing really good,
accessible, easy to achieve easy

131
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,970
to kind of draw a line and say I
haven't I have completed this

132
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,980
issue. issues. You can put your
name as a mentor or you can find

133
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,550
other people in your community
to say that they will kind of

134
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:16,560
particularly Shepherd this task
along and they are available for

135
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,290
answering questions, those folks
and try very hard to reserve

136
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:27,420
those issues, try really hard to
kind of keep them only for the

137
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:32,400
newest members if you can. And
if you have a good issue, we'll

138
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,040
have some information on how to
get started, where to find helps

139
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,370
and clear requirements. And then
making sure that it's got the

140
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:45,270
resources that votes and so you
can make sure to try and stay as

141
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,150
be as friendly as possible and
say thank you, welcome them and

142
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,830
give good consistent and helpful
feedback as best you can. So

143
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,790
rather than be tempted to
complete the task for someone

144
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,420
Try and solicit the challenges
that they're having, in order to

145
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,170
guide them to completion, it
feels amazing when you complete

146
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:13,020
a piece of work. And if you've
had someone support you along

147
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,520
that journey, it's a really
sticky in a good way, way of

148
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:23,880
joining in staying unity. Try
and think about just as sort of

149
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,560
some other examples from a
mentorship point of view. If

150
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:31,260
people are going to discover the
project, they're going to

151
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,620
participate for the first time.
And we're going to have first

152
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,290
contact them, they'll
participate. And then you need

153
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,530
them to stay or you would
ideally like a lot of them to

154
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:44,430
stay, to think about what you
need, what people will need from

155
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,310
you in order to stick around.
And these are just some of the

156
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:53,880
examples. Think about your
projects. And so working open is

157
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:59,010
being responsibly responsive
your community needs and there's

158
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:06,420
a bunch of different solutions
here. And I am going to finish

159
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,790
and let you kind of think about
how you would like your project

160
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,140
to succeed going forward.
