1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Unknown: I'm a PhD student I
used to I study how the Open

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,460
Science how our movement can
contribute to democratize

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,010
science and technology,
especially in the global south.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:13,020
And I have other power projects
that if you want to, you can

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:20,010
contact me I can tell you about.
So just to start, sorry, let's

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,710
go there. So science, you know
this better than anyone

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,100
but

8
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,629
also mostly in life science, but
science, humans tools, you can

9
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:33,299
do anything, if you you can
produce data, if you have your

10
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:39,029
tools, which are super wide
variety of rights, like analog

11
00:00:39,029 --> 00:00:43,979
tools, electronic tools, what
tools as as we are not only

12
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:48,239
talking about electronics, which
is the first image that appears

13
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,529
there when we talk about open
hardware. But all the tools we

14
00:00:52,529 --> 00:00:56,849
use in the scientific process in
this research process, we could

15
00:00:56,849 --> 00:01:02,009
say 99%, today, they are closed.
And when we say they're closed,

16
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:04,919
we're talking about that the
designs of the tools, the

17
00:01:04,919 --> 00:01:09,959
blueprints, how to have the tool
is not available for anyone but

18
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:14,009
the vendor. So this is like the
equivalent of proprietary

19
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:18,839
software, let's say. And this
brings some problems for

20
00:01:18,839 --> 00:01:23,279
researchers and for society in
general. So especially for for

21
00:01:23,279 --> 00:01:25,829
researchers, one of the problems
is that when you don't have

22
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:31,019
access to the design of or to
understand how your two words we

23
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:35,879
call that is a black box. It's
complicated when you don't fully

24
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:41,009
understand how the process of
sample to data is performed.

25
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:44,699
This has some problems not only
for the for the research and

26
00:01:44,699 --> 00:01:47,939
knowledge production process
itself, but also for example,

27
00:01:48,029 --> 00:01:52,469
when this equipment breaks down,
and you have to wait for the

28
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:56,639
supplier to repair it, and you
have a big delay waiting times

29
00:01:56,639 --> 00:02:00,959
for because you're probably not
a big force to push for the

30
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,139
vendor to come and repair your
your equipment. This is

31
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:10,379
especially more difficult in
countries where that are not far

32
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:14,819
away from the from the factories
or from the centers where these

33
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:20,219
tools are produced. Another
another pain, let's say is that

34
00:02:20,249 --> 00:02:23,609
the tools are very difficult to
customize. And usually in

35
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:26,429
science, you want to customize
your tools. Because if you're

36
00:02:26,429 --> 00:02:30,089
doing cutting edge research,
then you know what you need. And

37
00:02:30,119 --> 00:02:33,659
it will be it's the case of many
researchers that they want to

38
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:36,269
tweak their tools. And it's very
difficult for them because first

39
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:38,519
of all, they have to reverse
engineering what they already

40
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:41,669
have, which implies open
equipment or trying to

41
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:44,039
understand how it works, there's
a lot of time that if they had

42
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:47,669
the blueprints, this will be
time saved. Another thing is

43
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:52,109
that usually it's really
expensive. And again, this is

44
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:57,299
feeding the knowledge gap that
we have between global north and

45
00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:00,419
global South countries, there is
a lot of science production in

46
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:03,029
global north countries. And
there is not so much in the

47
00:03:03,029 --> 00:03:07,529
global south countries because
it's mainly many, many factors.

48
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:10,919
But one big factor is that
people don't have access to

49
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:15,629
equipment equipment is very
expensive. So all this pains

50
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:20,669
that are derived from having
closed hardware are a reality.

51
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:23,609
And it's something that people
have been addressing for a long

52
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:28,529
time. But the good news is that
people make tools. And in the

53
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:33,749
last 10 years, let's say there,
there has been a big wave of

54
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:37,889
people all around the world
building and building different

55
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:41,549
kinds of artifacts, not only for
science artifacts in general,

56
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:46,379
there are many factors for
explaining this. One of the most

57
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:49,529
important factors is the 3d
printing revolution, let's say

58
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:53,429
because most of these artifacts
are combinations of 3d printed

59
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:57,269
parts and low cost electronics.
So another factor is that

60
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:01,619
electrons nowadays are quite
accessible. And another

61
00:04:01,619 --> 00:04:05,009
important thing is that the
arrival of boards easy boards,

62
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:08,549
like Arduino allowed not only
researchers but people in

63
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:12,359
general allowed people to tweak
electronics to play with them

64
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:18,929
too. As your was mentioning, do
an iterative process over

65
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,009
electronics, improving the
designs trying You don't have to

66
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:27,779
be able to solder in order to
try things so everything is

67
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:31,289
becoming easier, and people are
just building stuff. So in this

68
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:35,939
slide, you see some of the open
hardware for science designs

69
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:40,169
that I wanted to showcase. In
general the rule is that if you

70
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:44,039
needed probably someone has
started experimenting with it,

71
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:46,979
and there is a design somewhere
in the internet that you will be

72
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:51,059
able to find. Um, so I'm showing
there the other month or the

73
00:04:51,059 --> 00:04:55,499
month is an open device open
acoustics device that people use

74
00:04:55,499 --> 00:05:00,869
it for monitoring noises in the
audible and non audio spectrum.

75
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:04,919
So it's a center biologist
working in conservation and

76
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:08,249
ecology in general. The other
one is

77
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,210
a very high tech device, which
is an open AFM and atomic force

78
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,260
microscope. And this is
developed by mpfl, Amazon

79
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,230
researchers working on a
laboratory of nano and bio

80
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:27,420
instrumentation. Again, they
have been dealing with closed

81
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,910
materials all the time, and they
work on developing

82
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,690
instrumentation. So they wanted
to, they reverse engineer

83
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,180
everything they could, and they
wanted to document it. So people

84
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,060
don't want to have to go through
that all over again, every time.

85
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,520
The third one open frog is
microfluidics platform developed

86
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,690
by Goldie labs. And the
interesting part about this is

87
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:52,860
that also the open drop is part
of a big set for bio open

88
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,550
biology instrumentation
developed by gaue labs to so you

89
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:01,380
can go there to link and check
it. Open flex shirt is a is a

90
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,340
microscope that is being used
right now to detect malaria very

91
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:11,940
easily. And in a very cheap way.
In Ghana, and in other, I think

92
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:17,160
in Peru coming soon. Open museum
is a very precise scale, that,

93
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,310
again, is open hardware. And
like your brains is a company

94
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,070
that makes open hardware,
neuroscience, neuroscience,

95
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:28,110
sorry, neuroscience experiments,
to teach neuroscience to kids at

96
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:32,070
schools in a cheap and easy way.
So all of these equipments, and

97
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:36,840
these are just examples are open
science hardware tools that have

98
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,490
some advantages over the
proprietary ones. In general,

99
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:48,510
and this is not Oh, sorry. I was
seeing the chat. We use backyard

100
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,660
tools in our rain. Oh, yeah.
Yeah, but your tools is super,

101
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:57,630
super popular. super nice. So
um, some some characteristics of

102
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:03,570
open hardware? Or why are people
building stuff? In general, open

103
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:07,080
hardware for science is more
affordable than proprietary

104
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,490
options. So this doesn't mean
that it's low cost, because

105
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:16,050
there is a big preconception and
misconception about open

106
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,610
hardware that all open hardware
is low cost, do it yourself, and

107
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:25,080
therefore it's associated with
less quality. And it's a it's a

108
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:29,940
common question that I get, like
from from researchers saying and

109
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,940
kind of published by very nature
using open science, Howard?

110
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:36,300
Well, yeah, we can. And there
are, like people are using open

111
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,410
zine forward to publish in in
journals, but no problem at all.

112
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,940
This leads me to another
important fact, that means that

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,020
if we know how tools work, then
we can talk about real

114
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:55,380
reproducibility. So we usually
try to push open hardware into

115
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,680
open science discussions,
because for us, it's pretty

116
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,650
important that in this whole
reproducibility crisis, we talk

117
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:05,130
about tools, right? If we know
which are the tools that people

118
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,130
are using, then we can
absolutely reproduce what they

119
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:11,310
have done in their research.
Another important thing, as I

120
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:14,430
was mentioning before, is that
this is repairable. So if this

121
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:18,390
is why universities are seeing
open, how are we good eyes right

122
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:21,720
now. Because if you have a fab
lab, which is something common

123
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,380
at university, and you have
techie people there and you your

124
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,410
tool is open hardware, then
maybe someone there can help you

125
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:31,140
repair it, and you have less
lace, and you have less waiting

126
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:35,160
times for you to use the
equipment again. And then

127
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,590
there's the learning and find
loads of people develop tools,

128
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:41,760
because it's a lot of fun. And
also because they can customize

129
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,960
and tweak instruments a bit just
to experiment with new things

130
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,280
without this, this waiting
times. Another benefit that is

131
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,600
usually overlooked a bit when
when we give talks for academics

132
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,930
and researchers is that it's
not. It's a big thing for people

133
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:04,380
in the global south. It's a big
thing when you have really small

134
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,620
budgets to do your research. And
suddenly with the same money,

135
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:12,090
instead of having one tool to do
your analysis, you have 10. And

136
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:16,980
we're talking of these orders of
magnitude, in terms of reduction

137
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,190
of costs. There are there is
research on this, where people

138
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,270
say there is a 90% reduction of
cost in equipment. So it's not

139
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:31,470
it's not as more often. So there
are lots of people doing open

140
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,710
houses for science. And I would
say most of them now are

141
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:38,100
gathering a community called
Global Open Science our or gosh,

142
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,760
this is a community of which was
created like the first gathering

143
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,140
was in 2016. Then we have
another gathering in Chile and

144
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:51,750
2017 and China in 2018. There is
the manifesto that you can check

145
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,560
online. I will give you the
links afterwards. But the idea

146
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,920
of this is that there is a
roadmap of the community and

147
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,590
everything is very, very simple.
disgust because it's a very

148
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:05,220
diverse community. The idea is
making Open Science how

149
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,210
ubiquitous by 2025, which is a
super ambitious goal, but we're

150
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:09,510
not

151
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:14,670
that far. So it's something to
take into account. And there are

152
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:19,560
lots of resources that you can
use within this community. So

153
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,070
what can you do if you think
that you could benefit from

154
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,290
using open science hardware or
you want to learn more about it.

155
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,100
So you can join the discussion
in our forum, it's a very

156
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,210
friendly space. Don't be afraid
You don't have to be expert in

157
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:36,180
electronics at all. Most people
are not most people here learn

158
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:41,280
on the internet with peers. You
can document if you have a

159
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,730
development and different
platforms, many people use, of

160
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:48,210
course, GitHub for software, but
they also use it for uploading

161
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,150
designs of electronics and 3d
printed parts. There are

162
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,680
specific platforms for this that
are now more than ever. Docker

163
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,500
breaks is one key reason other
some people do it an Open

164
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,740
Science Framework to you can
follow open heart leaders,

165
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,540
sorry, which is our program for
supporting people who are making

166
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,900
open science, how we're in
science, and auto science. And

167
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,630
there is also a journal that is
managed by the community, the

168
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,840
Journal of open hardware and
special thing about it also,

169
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,780
besides being a community
journal, of course, open access

170
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:24,930
is that we review the designs
which is not common, right. So

171
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,870
you submit your source files,
and we take a look at them and

172
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:31,170
we make sure that everything you
have there is open and available

173
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:35,370
to everyone. So some useful
links, I leave them there you

174
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:38,610
have the links to the slides in
the notes. We have a

175
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,090
collaborative list of resources
for open hardware fills in

176
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:47,880
GitHub, feel free please to edit
and comment. There is a lot of

177
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,390
coming for Open Sans how
community in 2020 in terms of

178
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:57,750
residences in terms of projects
that are scaling a bit and feel

179
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,930
