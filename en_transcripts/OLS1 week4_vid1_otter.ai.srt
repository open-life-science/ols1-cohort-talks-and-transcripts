1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,560
Unknown: open licensing and more
generally, is a fantastic way to

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,610
make your your work available to
people to collaborate,

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,590
collaborate, especially across
institutions. I've worked inside

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,860
of companies that used open
source licensing, just so that

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,770
they could collaborate with
other subsidiaries seamlessly.

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,150
And so it's it's kind of
incredible the boundaries that

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:30,750
open source allows us to, to
work across. Are these are just

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,040
a quick check. Josh, should we
be seeing slides? I think so.

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,000
Let me Okay, let me try this
again.

10
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,820
So we can see the cohort called
notes right now.

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,960
What that is, I see, I selected
the wrong cat. I'm so sorry.

12
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,040
We see them. Brilliant. Whoo.
Okay.

13
00:00:56,369 --> 00:01:02,279
So this, this is, uh, this is
what I said, This is me. Okay.

14
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:06,419
So yeah, the the fantastic thing
is, once you've got open

15
00:01:06,419 --> 00:01:09,419
licensing on something, it makes
it so much easier to collaborate

16
00:01:09,419 --> 00:01:13,409
with people, and for people to
build on your work. But I think

17
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,949
largely the folks here, I think
I'm probably preaching to the

18
00:01:16,949 --> 00:01:24,659
choir with that. So I'm going to
move merrily along. So one of

19
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,539
the things that we spoke about
in our breakout session briefly

20
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:31,289
was that, you know, I may be
specializing and specialized in

21
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:38,549
open source. And ostensibly, I
have sort of a sense of like

22
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,129
best practices for how to build
a project that's open from the

23
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:46,529
very beginning. But there are,
but even even given the

24
00:01:46,529 --> 00:01:50,639
expertise that I have, I have
struggled to build open

25
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:55,649
projects, often time that they
take a little take more

26
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,239
forethought and planning either
than they might otherwise. And

27
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:04,109
particularly when you're working
on deadlines, sometimes it's

28
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:07,769
it's, you know, in tech, it's
really unfortunate that often,

29
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:10,679
you know, things like
accessibility and security, or

30
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,299
open sourcing often end up being
afterthoughts. And so like, my

31
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:19,199
own experience has shown that to
be true, despite my expertise.

32
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:26,009
So I think I really just want to
implore people to plan ahead of

33
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:32,189
time to, to take the time to
think about these things so that

34
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:36,029
you can build for an open
project from the very beginning.

35
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:39,869
Because ultimately, the reason
we do open source and open

36
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:46,019
licensing is because the values
outweigh the the the costs of

37
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,669
doing that planning. But we just
need to sort of Route ourselves

38
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:54,449
in our commitment to being open,
so that we do take that time

39
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:55,529
upfront to make it happen.

40
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:08,670
So a huge when people talk about
open source, they're often it's

41
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,300
a term that's a little
overloaded. Open Source

42
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,910
tactically, just speaks to
licensing, right? An open source

43
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,640
license is a license that
conforms to the Open Source

44
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,440
Definition, talk a little bit
more about that later. And so

45
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,400
there are open source projects
that are out there, that people

46
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,430
will just put an open license on
it. But they may not actually

47
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,130
accept the interested in
collaborating with people, maybe

48
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,360
they just wanted to share it. Or
maybe they they are interested

49
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,400
in collaborating with people,
but only people within their

50
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,410
organization. And so often, when
I think about open source, I

51
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,410
think about three really
important aspects of it. First

52
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,620
is the licensing. And because
that everything sort of flows

53
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,380
from from that. But the second
is the sort of the collaboration

54
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,070
model. When people think about
open source, it's, they're often

55
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,790
implying something about the way
that people collaborate around a

56
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,780
project. That is that the source
code and the assets are freely

57
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,230
available and inspectable. And
that anybody can open a pull

58
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,590
request or raise an issue, and
then that'll be triage and

59
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:21,120
accepted from the community. The
last component is not just open

60
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,530
collaboration, but open
governance. And this is this is

61
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:30,600
one of the more tricky aspects.
But you know, for instance,

62
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:34,290
let's look at the Google's
Android open source project.

63
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,500
It's an open source project, it
is under an open source license.

64
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,760
But it does not use the open
collaboration model, because

65
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,010
they don't accept pull requests
or issues from people outside of

66
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:48,990
the company. And it's not openly
governed, because well, it's it

67
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,570
is a Google project and they
decide everything that goes on

68
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:56,910
with it. You compare that to
projects like NumPy or Sai pi,

69
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,840
where these are projects that
are under open source licenses,

70
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,360
they are owned, or they have an
open collaboration model. And

71
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,930
they're also governed by
foundations and nonprofits, that

72
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,070
has like an open governance
scaffolding. So there are ways

73
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:17,730
to not just be a contributor,
but ultimately to join the

74
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:22,590
technical steering committee or
participate in decisions about

75
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,740
the outcomes of the project. So
I just want to unpack open

76
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,260
source broadly, because it means
a lot of different things to

77
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,980
different people. And you can
see how those three facets can

78
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,280
contribute to sometimes the
misunderstandings, and it's

79
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,800
really important for us to
understand what our intent is

80
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,100
what level of openness we're
working towards, when we're

81
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,990
building a project. Suffice it
to say, a successful open source

82
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,020
project is a lot more than just
an open source license. And

83
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,900
there are a lot of details here
that are included. Like, you

84
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,700
know, at the beginning of the
call, we mentioned the code of

85
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:58,020
conduct. You know, I've been
planning and there's so much

86
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,250
that goes into it. But let's
not, let's not get overwhelmed

87
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,740
with it is you know, one step at
a time as we build open

88
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:10,320
projects. So all open licenses
share these three things in

89
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,580
common. The Free Software
Foundation has like the four

90
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,200
freedoms, the Open Source
Definition has the the tin, tin

91
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,350
clauses that things must be
compliant with to become open

92
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,530
source. But ultimately, they all
share three things in common.

93
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,610
Anyone can use the word for any
purpose, that anyone can modify

94
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,420
the work, and people can share
that work freely as well.

95
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,160
In any license, there are both
the rights that you get, as well

96
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,880
as the responsibilities, no
matter how simple or brief the

97
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:54,240
licenses any effective license.
Certainly any OSI approved

98
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,680
license is going to have both of
those sections, there are there

99
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,370
are open style licenses out
there, like the beer ware

100
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:10,260
license or the WTF Pl miticides,
do whatever the you want. And

101
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:16,620
those are essentially considered
to be like the WTF PL license is

102
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,710
considered to most likely be
most similar to like a public

103
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:24,690
domain commitment. And
interestingly, public domain is

104
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:28,110
not open source. There's an
interesting literature around

105
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:34,800
that. And that cc zero is also
not open source. But it's but

106
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,690
it's a good, it's a good thing.
So I'm never gonna dissuade

107
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:41,070
people from using it, the
history there's complex. But as

108
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:45,210
I was saying, there are rights
and responsibilities. And often

109
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,270
one of the responsibilities that
comes with an open license is

110
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:53,040
the responsibility of
attribution. So that means, you

111
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,640
know, declaring who the who the
original author was, or where

112
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:02,790
you got it from and linking back
to that you'll often notice in

113
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,930
particularly like in your
software applications, that

114
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,270
question I'll get to that in
just a moment, you'll often

115
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:16,140
notice if if you in the software
that you use, there's there's

116
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,020
usually like, you know, an about
screen. And in that about

117
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,530
screen, there's often a
declaration of attribute of open

118
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,800
source licenses and attribution.
And so that is where that

119
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:30,900
software maker is honoring their
responsibility to, to attribute

120
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:38,910
CC by is a license. In fact, all
of the all of the Creative

121
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:43,860
Commons licenses are licenses,
even cc zero, which is in, in

122
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,620
practice, effectively, a
commitment to the public domain

123
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,780
is also a copyright license. So
all of these are licenses that

124
00:08:51,780 --> 00:09:02,070
are spelling out your rights,
and all but cc zero really, also

125
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:05,370
spell out your responsibilities.
Because cc zero is sort of a

126
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,190
commitment to the public domain,
there is no responsibility,

127
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,070
there is no requirement for
attribution. There is no

128
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:14,520
copyright holder, they've sort
of disclaimed their ownership at

129
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,610
that point. But But again, these
are all copyright licenses,

130
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:23,160
they're they're hacks on the
copyright system. And so, you

131
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,400
know, even the copyleft things
or the public domain cc zero

132
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,010
things, though, they're
copyright licenses, there's

133
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:36,360
they're explicitly about just
claiming the copyright. So I

134
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:42,720
mentioned copyleft. And broadly
speaking, in open source, there

135
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,520
are two broad subsets of
licenses. There are the

136
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,370
permissive licenses are non
reciprocal, and there are

137
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,130
definitely different words used
here. Sometimes the words have

138
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:57,780
baggage. So I try to be pretty
even handed in how I describe

139
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:05,070
them. permissive licenses like
MIT BSD, the Apache License 2.0.

140
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,280
They don't require. So say you
take a piece of software, and

141
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,560
you make a derivative work from
it, you modify it. In a

142
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,920
permissive license, you are not
required to share your

143
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,360
modifications under that same
license, you can license them

144
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,380
differently, you can license
them under proprietary license.

145
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,050
That's, that's totally up to
you. And it's, it's your

146
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:35,070
prerogative to decide what you
want to do there. On the other

147
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:38,250
side, we have copyleft licenses.
And even in this category,

148
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:43,590
there's a continuum from from
weak to strong copyleft. And

149
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,190
these are sometimes called
reciprocal licenses, because I,

150
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,270
as someone who has authored,
say, a GPL, v3 software that you

151
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,480
are now using, and you are now
modifying and creating

152
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,670
derivative works with, because
it's under the GPL, v3, you are

153
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,140
have a responsibility to provide
your modifications under that

154
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:09,990
very same license. And there's
things out there like the A GPL,

155
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:13,980
which is a strong copyleft
license that specifically speaks

156
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,980
to software that operates over a
network. Ultimately, these are

157
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:25,620
all valid and good licenses and
picking one. Don't worry, it

158
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,490
doesn't need to be too
complicated. But ultimately, you

159
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:33,150
will need to make a decision
about depending on the use case

160
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,210
of your project, what what is
appropriate for you.

161
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:48,030
So open source is really all
about copyright. It's not about

162
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:53,310
trademark. And, of course, there
are at least three areas of

163
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,260
intellectual property law,
there's there's copyright,

164
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,500
there's trademark, and then
there's also patents. Largely

165
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:03,600
open source licenses don't say
much about patents. Some of them

166
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,610
do explicitly, this explicitly
include a patent grant, to the

167
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:14,760
people who are using that
software. The precedent that the

168
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,330
whole industry is operating
under right now is that even if

169
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:22,020
an open source license doesn't
explicitly include a patent

170
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:26,460
grant, the operating assumption
is that there is an implicit

171
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:34,620
patent grant, at the very least.
So I know that patents and

172
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,590
especially in context of
academia, there's a question of

173
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,950
tech transfer translation. How
does this technology How does

174
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:45,630
this work that get translated
to, to do industry or to

175
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:50,400
something that will drive
impact. And I know that I was

176
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,150
recently at Johns Hopkins,
trying to help help some of

177
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,250
their good people in their
library, persuade their tech

178
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,300
tech transfer people that, you
know, open licensing is not,

179
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:06,480
there's not to be feared. And so
anywho patents are often one of

180
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,080
the things that people get a
little, you know, people who are

181
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,710
not used to open licensing, they
can be sort of afraid of the

182
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:19,530
prospects here. But suffice it
to say, patents, there's an

183
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,830
implicit if not an explicit
patent grant, when you put an

184
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:25,770
open license on something, it
doesn't mean that you can't

185
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,770
patent things, it just means
that you're there's there's a

186
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:36,390
grant that's flowing through
that license. So there are

187
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,560
happily tools and resources out
there to help you navigate

188
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,760
choosing a license. Choose a
licensed calm is pretty great.

189
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,520
Creative Commons has a lot of
really plain language,

190
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:53,220
explanations of the different
licenses that they have. The

191
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,810
number one thing that I would
recommend is looking not only

192
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:03,630
looking at these resources, but
if you are creating a project or

193
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,840
you know writing some code to to
analyze some results, or

194
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:11,880
whatever the case may be. Look
at the licenses that are common

195
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,990
in the community you're
releasing the code into. So in

196
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:20,460
the JavaScript ecosystem, it's
often the NIT or the BSD

197
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:27,090
license. In the PHP ecosystem,
or in Java, it's often the

198
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:31,680
Apache License. And like there's
no value judgment on those

199
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,350
things. It just happens to be
sort of common practice within

200
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,790
those communities to use a given
license. And so if you're

201
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:43,620
looking for collaboration and
participation from people in

202
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,470
that community, you know,
abiding the community norms is a

203
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:51,150
pretty, pretty solid way to
start engaging with them. So

204
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:55,020
consider both what is typical in
that community, as well as what

205
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,500
the specific constraints and
goals are of your project, and

206
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,410
these resources will help you
narrow data, there's decisions.

207
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:10,530
So open source is really, really
just about code, which is, you

208
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:13,860
know, obviously, the work that
we all do is so much bigger than

209
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,660
just software. We deal with
data, we deal with imagery, we

210
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,420
deal with other all manner of
assets, we deal with hardware.

211
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:26,550
There are open source hardware
licenses. In the Creative

212
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:31,290
Commons does a fantastic job of
providing licenses for open open

213
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:34,980
data and sort of open content.
So whether it's for the white

214
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,330
paper, or the textbook, or the
data set that goes along with a

215
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:43,470
project, Creative Commons is
really, really fantastic sort of

216
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:48,750
catch all set of licenses. And
of course, there are variations

217
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:54,090
that include, you know, require
attribution, or require you to

218
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:58,830
share your code, the derivative
works in the same way. And then

219
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:02,010
there are ones that even our
have a non commercial clause, of

220
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:04,800
course, once we add non
commercial classes, well, that

221
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,020
gets even further from open
source and open licensing,

222
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,300
because then we're making
judgments and putting

223
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:15,540
restrictions on who can who can
really use it. So there's a

224
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,590
question here about what happens
when we import multiple

225
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:25,830
libraries from other projects,
and which licenses apply to the

226
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:29,160
work that we're creating? So
this is a really good question.

227
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:36,210
There are two triggers, in
licenses, generally, to be aware

228
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:36,450
of

229
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:42,240
one trigger is distribution,
which is like the moment that

230
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,870
you are distributing the
software, whether that's, you

231
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,480
know, I'm running it on a web
server, and you're using it or,

232
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,960
or I'm sending you software
that's on a disk, or I'm sending

233
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,170
you a little robot or a little
sensor that has software I built

234
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:02,910
on it, those all count is forms
of distribution. And the

235
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:08,190
distribution. Usually, that's
where some of the

236
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:13,590
responsibilities kick in, like
the attribution, or the

237
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:21,960
requirement to share your work
in the same way. When you

238
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,670
inevitably end up using software
that's licensed multiple

239
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:34,110
different ways. The one that
applies to you. No, apologies

240
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:37,020
only backup. So first
distribution, second is the

241
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,680
derivative works. And then copy
and copy left, the moment you

242
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,710
make a derivative work. And that
means really modifying that

243
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:49,710
software. So if you look at the
Linux operating system, there's

244
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,280
broad agreement under and
understanding that if I modify

245
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,520
the Linux operating system
itself, that's me creating a

246
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,330
derivative work. And therefore,
the software because it's under

247
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,810
a copyleft license, the software
I create needs to be shared

248
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,560
under that same license.
However, if I'm building an

249
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,760
application on top of Linux, you
know, similar to like, Okay, I'm

250
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,760
not modifying windows, but I'm
building software for people who

251
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,200
use Windows, same thing, Linux,
Mac OS, what have you. If I'm

252
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,080
building something in the user
space on Linux, that's not a

253
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,730
derivative work. And so I'm not
required to distribute my work

254
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,210
under the license that that
Linux is under, which is GPL,

255
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:35,400
v2. So the most restrictive
license isn't necessarily the

256
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,190
one apply that applies to your
work, you have to ask yourself

257
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:43,170
two questions. What are you
distributing? And what are you

258
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:49,230
deriving your work from? And
those are obviously like, not

259
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:53,070
always trivial questions to come
up with answers with. But there

260
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,190
are lots of good people in the
community who are happy to

261
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:00,480
provide advice on these things.
Obviously, always recommend

262
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,390
speaking to legal counsel. But I
will also say that the Open

263
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,570
Source Initiative does a lot of
low key consulting for people.

264
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,420
You know, whether it's the, you
know, the EU in their copyright

265
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:16,950
directive or the US and their
Federal Open Source policy, are

266
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,720
various agencies trying to
figure out how to use open

267
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,210
source or universities doing the
same. There are we exist, and

268
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:33,330
we're happy to help provide
guidance. So here are a number

269
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,930
of resources that I think there
are a few that were already

270
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:41,460
included here. I added a couple,
a few myself. These are

271
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:45,060
excellent resources for getting
more information, both about the

272
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,030
licensing, and more generally
building open source

273
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:52,470
communities. Open Source guide
is one that I've added here

274
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:56,370
that's specific that includes
questions of licensing, but also

275
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,490
like okay, how do I build a
community around this? What are

276
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,580
really the key components of the
community Code of Conduct is a

277
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,940
great start. But what about the
governance? How do we recognize

278
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,710
our contributors? How do I set
expectations with the community?

279
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,470
What expectations do they need
me to set? You know, all of

280
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:18,600
these questions, I'm happy to
say are like not new. And so

281
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,080
there's a lot of prior art out
there to help provide guidance

282
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,420
on these matters. For your
future with open source, I

283
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,970
apologize. That's that's a
that's a book. It's not open

284
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:35,250
source book either. And further
apologies disclaimer is written

285
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,880
by a good friend of mine. But it
is a really, it's it is the only

286
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,240
book that is written
specifically for newcomers to

287
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,610
open source. And I think it has
a lot of really useful

288
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:52,140
information in that regard.
Producing OSS is a book that is

289
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,740
open source from Karl Fogel when
the former directors of the Open

290
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:00,840
Source Initiative, incredibly
useful information. And I'd be

291
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,050
remiss if I didn't underscore
the Open Source Definition there

292
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:07,260
at the top. That is, of course,
the definition of the

293
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,040
organization and a part of
stewards and uses to judge

294
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,050
whether a new license is open
source or not.

295
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:16,860
So I think

296
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,970
I think that's the extent of
what I've got for you. And I

297
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,460
apologize, I think I might have
gone over time, but I hope that

298
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:23,970
was useful.
