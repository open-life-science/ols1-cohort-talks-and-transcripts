1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,110
Unknown: I'm Malika Sharon, I
work as a community manager for

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,360
the children way that Kirsty is
the lead for, and I'm also your

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,890
oil as team members. The topic
that we're going to discuss

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,820
today is called mountain of
engagement. And it is about

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,630
discovering pathways and
patterns in engagement in your

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,940
work. So first of all, when we
talk about

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:29,910
mountain,

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,690
at workspace, this is something
that you all can imagine we have

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,440
management level. And within the
organization, each of these

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,530
members are leaders with
responsibilities of certain

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,490
tasks that are delegated to
them, or that they delegate to

12
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:49,500
others. And they also are
responsible to finish them. One

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,490
does this for them is to create
sense of reward for finishing

14
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,610
certain tasks, but also they
find proportionately, so

15
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,030
appraisals and promotion, that
allows them to gain more

16
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,530
leadership abilities. And we're
going to think about that, in

17
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,480
terms of our members, we will
talk about if these kinds of

18
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,050
mountains can be specifically
adapted within a community of

19
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:17,040
members, to help them understand
what kind of tasks they like to

20
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,760
engage with, and how we can
offer them recognition for their

21
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,670
work and provide more
opportunities for skill building

22
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:29,220
and leadership within the
community. This is one of my

23
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,030
most favorite sketches ever,
because we helped design this.

24
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,140
It's because we often talk about
collaboration, when we start

25
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,710
thinking about engagement, and
collaboration and research space

26
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,420
often gets limited to topics
like, what project is this? Who

27
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,090
are we going to work with? What
are our common goal? What are

28
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,540
the resources and skills we
have? And the things that

29
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,140
actually matters? because it
affects all the stakeholders

30
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,650
like, how are we going to teach
the act with them? How are we

31
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:04,020
going to be providing them an
inclusive workspace? Do we have

32
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,010
Code of Conduct? Are we aiming
to build a diverse team, these

33
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:12,000
are often not the first thing
that comes in mind when talking

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,260
about collaboration. But you
have spent your last month

35
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,010
creating things like Code of
Conduct contribution, guideline,

36
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,850
open licenses, and so on, which
is basically focusing on the

37
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:30,300
lower part here. So now coming
to the engagement, community

38
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,870
engagement is about giving equal
opportunities to all your

39
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,770
members to exchange values and
empower each other to act on

40
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,280
issues that enhances community
experience and help achieve a

41
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,540
positive outcome. So the focus
is providing the opportunity,

42
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,870
empowering them so that they can
act. Mountain of engagement

43
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,560
helps us discover pathways and
patterns of engagement in our

44
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,860
work. It helps us discover how
people interact with our

45
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,020
community and organization, and
how our cultures get affected by

46
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,540
how do we discover patterns that
help people move from one type

47
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,720
of interaction to other types of
interaction? Can we develop

48
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,840
pathways for them to move from
first contact to sustained

49
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,720
engagement to leadership? So
basically, this picture, again,

50
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,410
where each of these members asks
specific question, if there is a

51
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:30,690
person who's very new to your
community, and they are aware of

52
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,750
other tasks within the
community, the question could

53
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,680
be, how can I move to the upper
level, there might be some

54
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,440
people who are just there,
because they like your

55
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,340
community, they're probably not
engaging very actively. There

56
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,500
are people who've been there for
a long time, and they want to

57
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,650
gain more leadership skills. And
then there are people who are

58
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,560
there who want to just do the
right task, use the right

59
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,250
resource and use effectively
their time. And then there are

60
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,590
people on the leadership who
might have just started by

61
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,600
fixing a small bug who are now a
regional head. So mounted

62
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:08,190
mountain of engagement have five
main steps. First is a list of

63
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:13,530
people's interaction with your
work. Second, is thinking about

64
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,250
deepening levels of engagement.
So in this case, you're going to

65
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:22,170
create a list of all the
interaction types that exist in

66
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,080
your community. And
independently, you will think

67
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,560
about what are the five levels
of engagement in the leadership

68
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,550
criteria you have. And then
you're going to put them

69
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:38,520
together as one single grouping
based on the engagement and the

70
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:45,750
type of interaction that you
have. Moving on. This exact

71
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,380
grouping will allow you to
identify patterns that works and

72
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:54,570
patterns patterns that do not
work. This could be for example,

73
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,340
what kind of conversation or
interaction platform do I have?

74
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,280
Does it work For everyone, if it
doesn't work do I want to

75
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,790
prioritize or not. So finally,
when you have identified those,

76
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,660
you can prioritize your work to
create more opportunities for

77
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,970
people. So this really helps you
to see what engagement effort in

78
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:23,610
your community really works. So
the first topic again, people's

79
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,630
interaction, you can think about
Twitter blogging article

80
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,580
mentions, bug report,

81
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:34,050
pull request, grant application
and hosting local events. So

82
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,040
this in terms of our
communities, also a task that is

83
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,850
done by community members. The
second one is about band of

84
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,540
engagement. So independent of
what kind of engagement

85
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,200
opportunities we have, we can
think about how do people come

86
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,290
in touch with my community?
First? How can they have

87
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,630
sustained relationship with the
community? And how can we

88
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,110
provide leadership? Or you can
even think about, if you're a

89
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:02,100
community that offers teaching
and learning resources, you can

90
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,670
think about people who come to
learn people who endorse your

91
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:09,330
community, who participate, who
collaborate, and eventually they

92
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:13,350
go on to lead? And then
combining them? What is the

93
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:17,040
first contact? Did they read my
tweet or a blog? to people who

94
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,920
are in the sustained
relationship? Are they

95
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,890
maintaining my resources, people
who are in the leadership

96
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,950
position? Are they taking
ownership of the local events?

97
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,950
And then finally, based on our
third point, we can think about

98
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,620
what are the pattern of
engagement? Who is moving up?

99
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,370
And how, what works for them?
Who gets stuck? Do they feel

100
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,540
frustrated? who leaves? And why
do they leave? Can we repeat the

101
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,550
success and avoid failures? So
these questions to ask when

102
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,580
you're identifying what works
and what doesn't work? What

103
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,760
makes it easy for someone to
move up in your mountain of

104
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,690
engagement? How can we make
those pathway easier for others?

105
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,740
What makes it difficult for
someone to move? And how can we

106
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,400
improve our support? Are there
places where people are happy to

107
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,670
be stuck? Just getting stuck is
not a problem, right? Sometimes

108
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,790
people just want to do something
that they like, they don't want

109
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:15,510
to particularly move to
leadership positions. So you

110
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:19,050
need to also think about that,
that you're not forcing people

111
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:23,010
to leave their band and go to
next level. And then you're

112
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:26,340
going to prioritize your work to
create more opportunities. At

113
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,400
this point, what's important is
to decide where to put your

114
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,040
effort. Maybe at this point of
time, you want to put your

115
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,850
effort in making your community
more visible. In the next step,

116
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:38,820
you might want to engage more
with the people who are already

117
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,780
there. And later step you might
want to go on and involve more

118
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,830
people who haven't heard about
your community. And in the, in

119
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:50,550
those cases, sharing stories are
very important, telling stories

120
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,700
of people who already exist,
what has been successful for

121
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,330
them, what what did not work,
what did you change, you need to

122
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:02,070
be communicating and things very
transparently. And specifically,

123
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:06,780
when you're creating an open
project, finally comes down to

124
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,500
reflection. What do you want it
to convey to your community

125
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,760
about how you value delegate and
elevate people in your culture?

126
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,110
So the reflection question could
be what kind of pattern do I see

127
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,680
as people move along the
mountain of engagement? What do

128
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,370
these patterns illustrate about
my community? And how should I

129
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:30,600
revise my own leadership goal.
So as a leader, open leader,

130
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:34,530
your role is to create
leadership opportunities for

131
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:39,900
others within your community. So
you're gonna collect a lot of

132
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,860
data when you're doing this. So
we need to tell you a little bit

133
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,850
about data. We are not lawyer,
and this is not legal advice.

134
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,090
But when you're using, for
example, survey, comply with

135
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:55,260
GDPR, or something similar that
exists in your country, keep

136
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,040
your data appropriate to your
needs. And don't use it for

137
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,720
different places that you
haven't been in. When you share

138
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,930
your data can your story you
want to tell and never change

139
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,660
the link so that people can come
back to and even track the

140
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:15,420
history of how you have advanced
in your community. I'm not sure

141
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:20,010
if GDPR applies to everybody's
work. But in any case, collect

142
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,430
the least amount of data in the
most anonymous way possible.

143
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,790
Share your policy and plan with
the participants early on

144
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,320
storage security, and use it
only as stated and deleted when

145
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,670
you're not using it anymore. And
the big story of this whole

146
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,030
mountain of engagement is to see
what your culture is if you

147
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:43,170
remember the culture,
conversation we had a few weeks

148
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,650
ago that culture develops. So if
you want to be a part of it or

149
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:50,070
not as your decision, if you
don't become part of agriculture

150
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,220
can move away from the vision
that you have established for

151
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:58,020
your community. Your engagement
actually shows what is what you

152
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,250
actually value. It's also
methodology for data collection,

153
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,070
engagement, equity and
storytelling. Because we're

154
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,340
working in a very digital world,
a lot of things can be only told

155
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,520
by data and the progress and
this is a good way to track

156
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:11,850
that.

157
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,370
So I'm quickly going to move on
to the community interaction

158
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,700
because it closely relates to
mountain of engagement, because

159
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,700
we talk about how are we
interacting with our community

160
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,450
and creating engagement
opportunities with them. So we

161
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:31,590
will be thinking about these
five things. Are we gifting

162
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:35,190
something? are we creating
something together? Are we

163
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:39,510
soliciting ideas? are we
learning through use? Or are we
