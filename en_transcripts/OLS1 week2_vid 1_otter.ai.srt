1
00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:03,629
Unknown: So here we are at,
these are three of us. So I'll

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:08,699
actually ask Bernice and yield
to introduce themselves. And

3
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:09,869
then I'll go ahead.

4
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:17,129
And Berenice was talking for in
Germany. And I'm happy to be

5
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:21,689
there and to have you in this
program. Yo,

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,300
Hey, everyone. So I'm yo yahudi.
I am a software engineer in

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,350
Cambridge, and I am really,
really excited to be working

8
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,480
with you all, for the next few
months.

9
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,580
Hey, so I am Malik Asher, and
I'm a community manager. This

10
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,180
until this week in Germany, but
I'm moving to London next week.

11
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,320
And I'm also super excited to
work on this. So again, three of

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,380
us have worked for several
months with really, really

13
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,830
generous people in our mentor
and expert group. And we're

14
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:56,070
really excited that we're
finally in a stage where we can

15
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,170
welcome you into the program.
The idea that connected us was

16
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,260
that we believe that our to be
effective science should be

17
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,130
shared openly with others and
made freely available. And you

18
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,220
are here with us. And you're
here because in some ways, you

19
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,990
also believe in the same idea.
The open Life Science Program

20
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,560
helps early stage researchers
and potential academic leaders

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,690
in becoming Open Science
ambassadors. And I assume that

22
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,530
you all had read something about
it before you apply for the

23
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,530
program. And we are happy that
you are willing to become that

24
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:37,260
ambassador in your community. So
it's it's something that we know

25
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,550
for decades, from probably from
the beginning of science that it

26
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,550
can advance only when we share
our work with others because

27
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,700
other people can build on what
you have done. And you can work

28
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,190
on someone else's work. But
often, we hear that researchers

29
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,040
are skeptical to be open about
their work, they don't want to

30
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,310
share it because they have fear
of getting scooped being openly

31
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:05,580
criticize. Or or other people
can spot mistakes in their own

32
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:11,010
work. So how can we work openly
without becoming scientifically

33
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:16,410
vulnerable? It's a really
complex question. The

34
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,070
vulnerability is quite different
for different people. And what

35
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,850
we are trying to do is in this
program, we want to explore what

36
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,730
are the important concepts and
practices in open science that

37
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,610
we can apply in our work one
step at a time without

38
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,890
overwhelming others. So life
science is a 15 week long

39
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,940
personal mentorship and cohort
based training, you would have

40
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,540
cold based calls like this one
every second week, and in

41
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,180
between, you will have one on
one mentoring call with your

42
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,770
mentor. And when you're not
talking to either of us, you're

43
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,920
going to have some hands on
practices will provide you with

44
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,040
assignments and after you have
gone through assignment, you

45
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,190
will be introduced to an idea
and concept which you will be

46
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:04,860
able to apply directly in your
project. So we will be using

47
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,250
Mozilla open leadership
framework which you can access

48
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:15,810
online openly to feel our open
life science journey. So this,

49
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,200
the whole idea of open
leadership is that open leader

50
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,560
design, build and empower their
projects and communities for

51
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,910
understanding sharing and
participation and inclusion. So

52
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,020
our open science definition goes
beyond just sharing data, but

53
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,050
it's also about bringing people
in. So you can do science

54
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:40,530
together. The open leadership
framework depends on design,

55
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,310
build and empower principle in
terms of understanding, sharing

56
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,690
and participation. For example,
are we designing our content for

57
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:53,340
someone else's understanding our
building it for people to share

58
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,880
in their network? Are we
empowering people for their

59
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,230
participation and inclusion in
our community? Can we inspire

60
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,500
their contribution? How can we
help people to take care of

61
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,970
themselves? How can we build
resilience? So our science is

62
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:15,150
not just about what we produce,
but people who are doing it? So

63
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,930
often, we get asked, What do we
know about what we think about

64
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,230
open science because everyone's
open science is quite different.

65
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,020
Open Science may mean quite
different things to different

66
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,740
people. So it could mean that
you want to share your data

67
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,310
openly, or you want to share
your code openly. You want to

68
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:36,060
design hardware or you want to
share your paper protocols. You

69
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,290
want to also start sharing your
results from early on before

70
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,250
even it goes into printing. And
then we also have huge focus on

71
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,580
knowledge sharing and training
and collaborating with people

72
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,850
openly like citizen science that
a lot of you are interested in,

73
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,450
but also connecting others in
our field and supporting them in

74
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:02,460
scientific networks. So what we
want to focus on from the

75
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,970
beginning is the design
thinking, how can we make our

76
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:12,330
project open by design 2012
studies showed that companies

77
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,650
that have level of strategic
intent to openness and not just

78
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,190
openness alone, so here the
intention is important. it

79
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:25,170
correlates with the market
performance. So design openness

80
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,990
into a work Don't let it be a
thoughtless default.

81
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,080
So with that, we believe that
you're already leaders in your

82
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,720
own community and you will come
with a vision and if you're

83
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,560
going to combine it with what we
are trying to provide through

84
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,500
our open Life Science program,
you can definitely achieve

85
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,600
positive cultural change in your
community.
