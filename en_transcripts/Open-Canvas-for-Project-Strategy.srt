1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Unknown: What we're going to be
talking about is the open

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:07,440
canvas. And you say, What is an
open Canvas? Well, I'm here to

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,360
tell you. So it is a short
exercise that we'll be asking

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,380
you to look at after this call.
It's basically a bunch of boxes

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,310
to fill out literally a box
checking exercise. But I found

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,970
that it's actually really quite
useful. It's in terms of, if

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,800
we're going to keep on going
back to some of the same

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,030
sentences about how open project
leaders behave. And in this

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,420
case, we're thinking about
designing so open leaders design

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,090
and build projects that empower
others to collaborate and

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,770
inclusive communities. And what
I mean by this, if you remember

12
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,050
the framework, the open
leadership framework that

13
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:48,420
malvika referenced in one of our
earlier presentations. So we're

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,420
specifically looking at when we
are thinking about our projects,

15
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,170
how do we design our project in
a way that is good for

16
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,560
understanding so people can
understand what's going on. And

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,190
so that people can interact with
you effectively, we're designing

18
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,190
our project in a way that helps
us to share things with people,

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,020
whether that be gifting some
knowledge, or some ideas or some

20
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,410
software or hardware or whatever
it may be that you are sharing

21
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,860
with people. And we're also
looking at designing in ways

22
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,220
that allow people to
participate. And by the way,

23
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,370
when I share my screen, you
can't see the zoom window in

24
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:27,720
front of it, can you you can't
see like a level video window. I

25
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:32,250
know Yes. No, I don't know.
Okay, excellent. Right, because

26
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,470
I have a blocking half of
screen. I didn't want to be

27
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,440
sorry about that. Yes. And the
final thing about the open

28
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,880
Canvas, it helps us write down
and specify our ideas in ways

29
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,270
that make it easy for people to
participate and feel included in

30
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:51,300
part of the community. So if I
move on to my next screen, that

31
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,200
too far, there we go. Right, the
so this is what an open Canvas

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,750
is. And so basically, it is
adapted from the lean canvas. So

33
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,790
if anyone's read, I think the
lean startup, then it has some

34
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,970
ideas about filling out these
boxes, writing down what exactly

35
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,010
it is that you've been thinking
about in your project in terms

36
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,800
of who contributes, how they
contribute, and so on. But I'll

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,380
drill down into this a little
bit more in detail. Yeah, people

38
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:24,150
going to make slides. Okay,
right. So if you see, on the

39
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,640
bottom left, there is
information about the project

40
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,310
execution. And the idea that you
sort of work through step by

41
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,940
step, you talk about who your
contributions are, what they

42
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:38,010
look like, what your user
profiles may be, so who are you

43
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,700
building your project for? You
move along a bit further, how do

44
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,480
these people contribute
contributed channels? So if you

45
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,910
say I'm thinking about who is
going to be participating my

46
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,570
project? So they need to know,
is this going to be as GitHub is

47
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:56,010
it going to be some other sort
of platform that I use, and give

48
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,580
information like the unique
value proposition? So why is the

49
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,150
thing that I'm doing interesting
to other people? I'm sort of

50
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,490
hopping around here, I
apologize. But I'll hop over

51
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,950
back for a bit, let's say to the
problem as well. So what are we

52
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:12,210
solving here? And if so, once
we've stated what the problem

53
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,540
is, what is the solution that's
going to be providing to this

54
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,050
problem.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,260
Apologies for hopping around a
little bit.

56
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,350
We'll move on to the next

57
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,130
slide. So we'll walk through
this in a bit more clear detail.

58
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,530
First of all, on the left, we
have information about the

59
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,810
product. So this is sort of tech
oriented. So what you may be

60
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,170
providing may not necessarily be
a product, it may be a service

61
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,150
or protocol or something like
that. But the end of the day,

62
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,900
it's a thing that you'll be
sharing with other people. And

63
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,900
then on the other side of that
the community is the people who

64
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,450
are going to be using and who
are going to be contributing to

65
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:51,630
your product. So first of all,
define your problem. So what is

66
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,410
it that you are trying to solve?
And so hopefully, perhaps with

67
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,260
the vision and mission statement
that you've been working on,

68
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,110
you've been thinking about what
this problem is, for us, for

69
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,120
example, if I were to do this
for open life science, the

70
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,420
problem is, science isn't always
as open as I would like it to

71
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,440
be. And then next of all, the
solution in our case will be

72
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,440
this program. I don't think it's
going to solve science entirely.

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,870
But I think definitely it helps
to create more people who are

74
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:24,150
able to work on sharing projects
together. Moving along a bit

75
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,820
further, how will you measure
this? And so again, thinking

76
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,730
through the example of the
organization's program, metrics

77
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,100
might be how many people have
retrained? How many people if we

78
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,100
run a second round? How many
people then go on to be mentors

79
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,500
later on? So you might want to
think about what metrics you can

80
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,230
apply to your project? How would
I measure whether or not my

81
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:45,030
project is actually being
successful in some way? And then

82
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:50,070
you think, Okay, so I've got my
big idea. How do I go and create

83
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:53,490
it, you know, who do I need to
speak to? Do I need to have

84
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,850
computer resources do I need to
have a lab and so depending on

85
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,800
your project, there may be
different things that you need

86
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,620
to start to get towards Working
that project, it may be

87
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,830
networking connections, for
example, I mean, networking

88
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,290
connections in the making
friends with people and

89
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:14,340
definitely not in the cabling
sense of. So then continuing on,

90
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,990
think about who's contributing,
and what would an ideal

91
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,590
contribution look like? That's
not physically but in terms of

92
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,010
their personalities, their
behaviors. So I might say that a

93
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:30,210
contribution to open AI science
is a mentor or an expert who can

94
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,270
share their knowledge. Another
type of contributor would also

95
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,630
be the participants you without
this without you, we wouldn't be

96
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:42,240
going anywhere. And then I say,
whoops. Okay, this is an

97
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,050
overview slide. Sorry. So
contribution profile should

98
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,100
fulfill the first woman windows
covering things should fulfill

99
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,790
the needs required to build your
product. Right? Yeah, that makes

100
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,430
sense. Okay, so basically, the
people who are contributing

101
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,890
should be the people who can
help you get those resources.

102
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:04,650
And that makes a lot of sense.
Okay, user profiles. So this is

103
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,050
slightly different from your
contributor profiles. So for

104
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,010
example, I suppose in this
scenario, the participants for

105
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,220
open life science might also be
the users. Or we might say that

106
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,460
our users are people who then
learn about open science in the

107
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,330
future from you. So think about
who the target audience for your

108
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:25,530
project is, and especially who
the early adopters are. So if

109
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,230
you had success, if you said my
project has been openly shared

110
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,990
with someone who would that
person be trying to find that

111
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,210
and contributed channels? Next
question, how do people actually

112
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:40,380
come to you? How did they
contribute? So in our case, I,

113
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,870
we haven't actually surveyed
you, but my guess would be a lot

114
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,330
of you heard of us through
Twitter. Some of you might have

115
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:49,500
heard of us through mailing
networks. I know we did some

116
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,260
talks, we did a webinar. So
those will be the contributor

117
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,860
channels for open life science,
and try to think about how you

118
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,120
might gain new contributions for
your channels for your project

119
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,650
as well. And then finally, the
channels for users. So how will

120
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,380
you gain new users that might be
the same way that you gain new

121
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,750
contributions, or it might be a
different way? Maybe you're

122
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,140
doing a training workshop? Try
and think through these

123
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,740
exercises. And I know certainly
when I did a lot of this

124
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,560
personally, I felt like, Okay,
I'm filling this out. But I feel

125
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,170
like I've just been made to fill
out a silly form. But then

126
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:26,130
afterwards, having filled out
and thought about how I'm going

127
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,610
to fill all this out, I realize
I thought very critically about

128
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,880
my project. And it made me think
and define it in ways that

129
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,380
previously I might not have
effectively done. And there's a

130
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:43,680
chat message. Okay. Hope
himanshi forgot your laptop

131
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:47,460
cable. Oh, no. Okay, well, good
luck to you. Hopefully, you can

132
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:53,580
find your power cable. Okay, and
where was I in my slides? Oh,

133
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,890
yeah. Okay, so community
engagement is talking about the

134
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:59,160
channels, the other channels and
contributed channels. And

135
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,610
finally, we have our unique
value propositions. So this is

136
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,200
saying, having thought about

137
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,930
whose contribution how they're
contributing, what resources I

138
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:10,350
need, and what my problems are?
What is the unique value, what

139
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:14,400
am I offering to the world that
is useful and interesting. And I

140
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,190
like to hear what you offer and
why you are different. I think

141
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,910
that's a really good way of
thinking about that. And then we

142
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:25,950
have a small example here. This
is for a Mozilla project called

143
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,770
contract contributors, badges
for science, I think that

144
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:32,490
projects end up being called
paper badger. And so it sort of

145
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,190
gives you a bit of an idea about
how they fought through the

146
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,940
problems, and then added them in
themselves. So saying, there's a

147
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,790
lack of recognition of certain
contribution types and academic

148
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,880
papers, and that people weren't
taking advantage of a web as a

149
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,790
medium, and then just sort of
think through different ways to

150
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,450
solve that to measure that,
basically, by providing budgets

151
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,900
of when people offer papers
based on their contribution. So

152
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,600
someone worked on the software,
someone did the editing, someone

153
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,800
wrote the words, someone did the
lab protocols, and so on. And so

154
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,320
that's a really good example. I
won't go through all of it now.

155
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,700
But the slides are available and
linked to from the agenda. So

156
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,000
you can review it yourself. And
I think that also the demo is in

157
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,480
our notes as well. And oh, but
is that my last slide? No. Okay,

158
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,070
nearly masks. But so if you want
to, this is the link where you

159
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,910
can actually go and access and
open Canvas yourself. So make a

160
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,970
copy of the document, and then
try and see if you can think

161
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,490
through and it's okay, if you
don't feel every single box,

162
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,210
maybe you can't find any boxes,
discuss it with a mental and

163
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,010
they can help you think through
but the bits that you're

164
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,430
missing, but I definitely find
it as a useful exercise to think

165
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,720
about things. And so thinking
back to what we've been doing,

166
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,170
we're trying to empower
researchers and academic leaders

167
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,570
to become Open Science
ambassadors and hopefully this

168
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,690
will help you design and
structure some of your plans for

169
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,320
further on.
