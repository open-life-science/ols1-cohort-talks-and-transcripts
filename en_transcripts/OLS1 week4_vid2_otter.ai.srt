00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
Unknown: Hello, I will be
talking about the readme files

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:08,370
and how we can implement or
like, how can you write the

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,550
written files for your project.
But first of all, like why, why

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,950
would you and what is the role
of the readme files? And, but no

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:23,400
icons? Yeah. Okay. So actually,
I look as the same as Josh. And

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,550
so I already introduced myself,
but briefly, my name is Manish

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,250
Kozak. I work in the Netherlands
Science Center. And actually,

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,090
quite a lot of my work is
involved in training and around

9
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,460
software best practices, and
where we also teach how to run

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,880
open source projects. So
creating reading files is one of

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,570
the things that we teach.
Actually, whenever I talk about

12
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,470
open source, I say you should
start with when you're starting

13
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,770
open source project to actually
start with open sourcing it from

14
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,440
day one, but then start with the
readme file, this should be the

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,340
first thing that you are
actually writing. And so I will

16
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,930
talk about how to use read me to
communicate your project

17
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,280
effectively, and learn how to
write the description of your

18
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,590
project. I will list some
examples where you can find more

19
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,890
so you can follow the links, you
can look at different examples,

20
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,990
but also some more resources
about how to write a readme

21
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,910
file. And, and then after I
stopped talking, you will

22
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,510
actually create your or revise
your README files or project

23
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:35,310
descriptions. And so I believe
this is where we are in the oil

24
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,840
LS project. So the readme file
touches upon communication and

25
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,260
people understanding what your
project is about. And actually,

26
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,360
so this is the I guess, the
motto of the open leaders. Yeah,

27
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,970
open sciences project. But
actually, I like it because it

28
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,730
fits very well with their what
why do we need README files

29
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:01,260
because you want to empower
others to collaborate? And if

30
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,770
the readme file is there to
actually empower them, so the to

31
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,120
give them tools and to give them
channels and to give them the

32
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,800
reasons to collaborate with you.
Yeah. And, and then the readme

33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,280
file is a bit like a like a
doormat where people see it

34
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,570
before they even enter the
project. Yeah, they, this is the

35
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:26,520
first thing they see. And so
what is the readme file there?

36
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,770
You're already mentioned that
this project, like we do use a

37
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,670
GitHub as an example of, or
like, we use it for other

38
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:43,380
collaboration platform. So the
GitHub uses README files, as I

39
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,300
like the first thing that people
see as a description of the

40
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,810
product. So README is in
principle, a file, which is

41
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:57,630
called README, uppercase,
README, it could be readme.md,

42
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,940
because usually, an especially
on GitHub, the format, or the

43
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,540
language that you would write
the readme in, would be

44
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,190
markdown. So that's why it's
readme.md, for markdown. But

45
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,940
it's cool. If you don't use
GitHub, if you have some use

46
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,240
some other platform, the readme
could be a web page, like the

47
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,320
front page of your project
describing your project. And,

48
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:28,140
and so as I mentioned, if you if
you read me is a file, and in

49
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,890
this file, you describe what
your project is about. And then

50
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:36,240
if you put this file in the root
of your project on GitHub, then

51
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,370
this will be the first thing
people see when they go to

52
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:44,130
GitHub, on GitHub, to your
project. And so this is really

53
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,610
the first opportunity, and often
the only opportunity because if

54
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,120
you lose this opportunity, and
people get discouraged, or don't

55
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,650
get interested in your project,
they might not come back. So you

56
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,540
should like, seize this
opportunity and describe your

57
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,850
project well. And so what should
go into the written describe

58
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,880
what you're doing on what the
project is doing? Who is the

59
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,790
audience of the project, why
people should be using your

60
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,360
project or like the the tools
that you're developing? And so

61
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,310
on why people would care? How
does this project differ from

62
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:26,730
other similar projects, and
maybe why people would like to

63
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:32,070
get involved in this project,
and how to get started, which

64
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,760
could mean how to get started
with using the things that the

65
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,270
project is about or how to get
started as a contributor. And I

66
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,510
think this is something that you
have to keep in mind that README

67
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,810
often will be for both types of
audience, it will be to the

68
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,510
people who will use the things
that your your project is about,

69
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,480
or people who would like to
contribute or collaborate on

70
00:04:51,480 --> 00:05:00,270
that. And then also list the
resources and so this is the The

71
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:05,490
example of the of the readme
file, how it's can be found on

72
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,860
GitHub. This is project by QC
Whitaker.

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,430
And you can see here like,
there's the welcome message, you

74
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,000
want to want to welcome people
who come see your project,

75
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:19,380
there's a description. And there
are links, description, how to

76
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,670
also links to the documents on
how to contribute or how to get

77
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,820
involved, what is the license,
what is the code of conduct. So

78
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:34,710
this is also like a place, which
will have a map to your project.

79
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,320
So people will find all the
links that are relevant for your

80
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,230
project. So they should be able
to find all those things from

81
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:45,480
the readme file. And so what
else? I think I believe it's

82
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,510
very important that in the
readme file, you communicate

83
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,570
expectations about the readiness
of your project, you don't want

84
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:57,660
people to start using the
project. Or Yeah, a to before

85
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,690
it's ready, or at least, like
they can use it, but they should

86
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:05,460
understand that it may be it's
not ready yet. And you should

87
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,060
communicate expectations for and
manage contribution to your

88
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,950
project as a how people can
contribute. And also what are

89
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:20,010
the communication channels. And
then I didn't like the use the

90
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,560
budgets in the readme files,
this is a nice way to

91
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,860
communicate things around your
project. So you can say, if you

92
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,470
would like to cite myself for
this is the goi if you would

93
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,370
like to download, this is the
link to the release. This is the

94
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:36,960
license and so on. And so these
things are called badges or

95
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,970
shields, I believe. That's the
sheets, I open the project. So

96
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,570
you can put it at the top of
your README file, which is nice.

97
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,680
Yo, how am I doing with time,
you're okay. But faster rather

98
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,850
than slower is probably

99
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,020
I can speak very fast, you know
that but maybe

100
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,220
medium fast, maybe

101
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,350
you can.

102
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,090
So you can add emojis actually,
I think emojis are very nice way

103
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:13,440
of making your README less dry
and more inviting and more

104
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,480
friendly in expression. Since we
are like, people are reading it,

105
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,560
it's very difficult to express
friendliness for the, for the

106
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,660
text itself. So I really advise
using emojis. And you can also

107
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,570
use animated gifs, which
actually I was struggling if I

108
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,500
should say that, but at the same
time. So I think it's very good

109
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:41,490
way to communicate very, in an
easy way describe what your tool

110
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,460
is doing without a lot of text,
people can just see what the

111
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:49,950
tool is doing. At the same time.
I think that does decrease the

112
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,580
accessibility or your of your of
your README. At the same time if

113
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:59,010
someone if if things about your
tool or project are visual, then

114
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,970
they they're visual anyway, so
I'm not sure I'm actually

115
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:08,940
interested in this, hearing your
opinion on that. And so it's

116
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:13,350
very important that you use
accessible language is simple

117
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:18,300
language, don't use the jargon.
It's very easy to expect like

118
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:22,140
you're in your domain, you're
describing the tool maybe or a

119
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,640
project which is within your
domain. So it's easy to like

120
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,910
stay in this bubble and and use
a lot of jargon that you think

121
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,330
everyone should look towards
everyone should be known. So

122
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:39,840
it's very nice example with the
you may be familiar with XKCD

123
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:48,900
comic and the outer was Randall
Munroe, I think and then he also

124
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,050
wrote the book, which is called
things explainer, where he only

125
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:58,230
uses the most common 10 100
words, to explain things. Here's

126
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,380
the rocket, which is actually
it's not rocket up color,

127
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,520
because the rocket is no not one
of the 10 100 most popular

128
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:12,090
words. And so he he This is like
an exercise of like really being

129
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,660
able to explain in very plain
wares, complicated things, which

130
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:21,060
actually turns out to be
possible. And also, don't use

131
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,580
acronyms, or at least explain
them if you if you do. And you

132
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,920
can. So we're not going to try
it now. But I think after my

133
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,890
talk will have a breakout, and
you're going to try out there is

134
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:36,930
an online editor which allows
you to do the same. So use the

135
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,760
only 1010 100 words, most common
10 100 words to describe your

136
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,300
project. So we will work on your
project description and the

137
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,950
readme file. And

138
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,750
there are some more resources.

139
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:53,490
And I actually really like the
list of awesome reasons. There's

140
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,510
not only the list of reasons but
there's also a lot of resources

141
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,390
that are listed that you can use
to learn more about how write

142
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,860
code really fast. And yeah and
that's me
