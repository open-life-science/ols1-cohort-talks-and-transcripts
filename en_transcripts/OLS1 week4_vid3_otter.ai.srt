1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
Unknown: So we're gonna now
switch to the last part, which

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,200
is about contributing guideline
and code of conduct. In the

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,400
call, we have today Karen liason
who was our expert for this

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,410
part. But I'll go through this
in one minute to introduce what

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,720
this part is for and why we're
interested in that. So if we go

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,600
in the next slide, you would see
this over and over. And we will

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,680
be highlighting different parts
of our vision statement. So

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,500
building project for
collaboration within inclusive

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,080
community. And in the next
slide, you will see that we're

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,230
now moving to this part, which
is about building for

11
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,730
participation and inclusion. So
who's making decision? Who's,

12
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,020
who's delegating tasks? Who is
delegated to? How are we

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,830
planning our event? How is the
community management happening

14
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,280
and was monitoring what's
happening in the community. So

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,040
when we work in an open
community, it's all about

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,580
relationship. you depend on
community members who are

17
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,060
volunteers, we're working on
your project, probably beyond

18
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,160
their own personal work time. So
it's really important how you

19
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,710
keep them involved, and identify
who's the active member, what

20
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,420
are their roles, how you can
give them autonomy, and how you

21
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,520
can also keep the governance so
your project does not derail. So

22
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,410
in the next slide, a will be
what we are going to do with

23
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:38,700
this stock is to make you think
about how to create a positive

24
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,970
culture, how to think about
contribution and collaboration.

25
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,830
And please keep note of the fact
that this is going to really

26
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,520
influence how you're going to
write your assignments and draft

27
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,060
your own contributing guideline
and choose a code of conduct for

28
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,850
your project that's really
appropriate for your community.

29
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,160
So with that, I'm happy to
introduce Karen liason, she is a

30
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:08,220
researcher in, in Norwegian
veterinary Institute, and also

31
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,670
Chair of the carpentries code of
conduct Committee, which is

32
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,930
where I work with her. And I'm a
huge fan of her work. And I'm

33
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,700
happy to have her on the call
today.

34
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,230
Thank you so much for that very
nice introduction. So this talk

35
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:31,860
will have will focus on two
documents in in this context.

36
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,260
And that's the contribution
guidelines, and also the code of

37
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:43,650
conduct. So the important thing
to bear in mind is that you as a

38
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,890
project leader, you're trying to
build a community around your

39
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,370
project, you're trying to
attract volunteers to your

40
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,200
project. And these will have
diverse backgrounds, and come

41
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,370
into your project with different
different expectations. Now,

42
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,870
whenever you have a group of
people gathered like this, a

43
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,280
culture a group culture is bound
to develop whether you intended

44
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,660
to do or not. And this means
that you as a project leader,

45
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,280
you have to take initiatives
with regards to what kind of

46
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,820
culture you want your project to
have. If you don't, a project

47
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:29,280
culture will develop without
you. And this means that you

48
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,310
have to be make some conscious
choices regarding how you want

49
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,600
your community to build. What
values should your community

50
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,730
advocate? How do you want people
to interact with each other and

51
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:51,090
with other people. The thing to
remember here is that a project

52
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:57,360
is actually a lot more than just
its scope, goals. It's a

53
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,920
language, it's a shared set of
norms, it consists of people's

54
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:06,780
expectations to the project.
It's the tools that you choose

55
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,210
to use. It's the systems you set
up to make decisions. It's the

56
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:18,120
project identity. And all of
these things affect the health

57
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:25,230
of your community, the community
around your project, and because

58
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:29,850
of that, it will also directly
affect the progress of your

59
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:36,300
project. Now, how do you go
about shaping the culture you

60
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:41,310
want? There are two big things
that can be done in this

61
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:46,200
context. And that's to have a
clear set of contribution

62
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,570
guidelines, which will help your
contributors your volunteers

63
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,940
interact with your project. And
the second is to have a code of

64
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,770
conduct and these are two things
Important vehicles that will

65
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:07,020
help you as a product leader, to
communicate to your community,

66
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:15,180
how you want your community to
be. So, what we're trying to do

67
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:20,730
is to get people to contribute
to your project. It's in this

68
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:25,410
context important to remember
that your contributors are

69
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:30,780
people with their own worldviews
and their own stories. We need

70
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,110
to take this into consideration
when we're trying to build a

71
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:39,960
welcoming atmosphere so that
people will want to contribute

72
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:47,340
to your project. One such
community, I'll show an example

73
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,510
here is the carpentries.
Community. That's the community

74
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:56,550
that I personally am part of.
And we've taken a very proactive

75
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,630
stance when it comes to
community to project culture.

76
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:05,820
And I'll show this through both
the contribution guidelines and

77
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:13,410
the code of conduct that this
project has set up. So first, to

78
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:18,870
the contributing documents. So
first of all, these are readily

79
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:24,750
available within each GitHub
repo for each set of teaching

80
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:29,640
materials, and we do this to
make sure that it's easy for

81
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,420
people to find them. So the
contributing guidelines have to

82
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,910
first of all, they have to be
easy to find, if you can't find

83
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:43,020
them, you can't use them. So
what kind of information should

84
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,700
these kinds of documents
contain? Should they contain

85
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:53,610
information that various kinds
of people might want to know? So

86
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,390
for your contributors to people,
you want to help you out with a

87
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:01,920
project, you want to tell them
the process and conventions that

88
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,400
they'll need to follow when
they're making a contribution.

89
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,820
It should also detail how they
are expected to interact with

90
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:17,550
other members of the community.
When it comes to the project

91
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:21,810
consumers, these are the people
who might want to build off the

92
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:26,820
work that you've done, it should
clearly detail how they can

93
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:32,790
remix and reuse your work in
their own projects. And this

94
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:36,390
file should give them the give
them a sense of how to do that,

95
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,750
and what's allowed to do with
the material.

96
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:49,320
You as a project owner, you will
want to create and maintain this

97
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,850
file. And you'll you should make
sure that you keep this file

98
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:59,910
updated. One good thing about
writing and creating this file

99
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:07,500
is that it will help sort out
for yourself how how you can

100
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:14,850
have good interactions in your
community. So let's look here.

101
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:19,470
For the carpentries we have in
addition to the contributing

102
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:25,470
document in itself, we've also
specifically set up web pages,

103
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,630
which will help people interact
with our community. So this is

104
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:36,090
shown here is a list of
channels, communication channels

105
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,520
into our projects, which helps
people help channel people into

106
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,100
the parts of the product that
they might want to contribute

107
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:50,250
to. And this makes it easy for
someone new to find out what

108
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,900
they can do. And this is this is
one very good way of doing that.

109
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:05,460
Okay, now we'll move on to the
issue of a code of conduct. Now,

110
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,600
the basis for this is that to
have a well functioning

111
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,920
community, we need to take into
consideration that the other

112
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,530
feature people that are in our
project are not carbon copies of

113
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:24,210
ourselves. If you're lucky,
you're able to build a diverse

114
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:29,160
community, for your project. And
a diversity of people and

115
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,020
opinions will make your product
stronger. It will help your

116
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:39,510
project be original and
adaptable and durable in the

117
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:45,870
long run. The issue then becomes
what if something happens in

118
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:50,820
your community that shouldn't
and this is where a code of

119
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:57,750
conduct comes into play. A Code
of Conduct speaks to what is

120
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:02,910
accepted and what is not.
accepted in your community. It

121
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:08,280
also speaks to what do we as a
community do when something that

122
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:16,260
is not accepted happens? So why
do you? Why do you actually

123
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:21,000
really need a code of conduct?
Well, there are really three

124
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,830
things that our code of conduct
does in your community, the role

125
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:32,850
they play place. First of all,
it helps invite new people to

126
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:39,600
your project, simply by saying,
Hi, we're here, please interact

127
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,490
with us. It also sets clear
expectations for community

128
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:49,860
members. It tells them how we
want people to behave, what kind

129
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:55,200
of interactions we want in our
community. Last but not least,

130
00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:00,990
and probably most important, a
having a code of conduct tells

131
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:05,970
your community that you care
about it, it tells them that

132
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:12,240
their well being is important to
your product. And that is

133
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,940
probably more is more important
on a community context. More

134
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,410
important than anything else.

135
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,150
So here, links in the
presentation that I'm assuming

136
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:31,440
that you'll get access to, there
are some examples of code of

137
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,770
conduct. And I'll now show you
the carpentries code of conduct.

138
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,030
So you can have a look at that.

139
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:49,260
So if we see here at the top, I
not Can you see my mouse? Okay,

140
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:55,260
so here at the top, this is the
welcoming part. But we quickly

141
00:11:55,530 --> 00:12:00,120
move into the setting
expectations part by clearly

142
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,430
stating that by interacting in
this community by becoming a

143
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:11,100
part of it, we expect you to
follow our code of conduct. And

144
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:19,410
we clearly say that not doing so
well have consequences. Next,

145
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:27,120
below here, we have described
some a few examples of behaviors

146
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,340
that we encourage in our
community. And this also helps

147
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:37,380
set expectations for our
members. Another thing that

148
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:40,770
you'll see in our code of
conduct is that we have clear

149
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:45,870
guidelines for how to deal with
incidents, if something happens,

150
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:52,170
we have guidelines and
procedures for what to do. And I

151
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:55,530
want to emphasize here that it's
very important to actually

152
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:59,730
enforce your code of conduct.
The only thing that is worse

153
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:04,470
than not having one is not
enforcing it. Because you have

154
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,950
if you have one and you don't
enforce it, what you're telling

155
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:11,730
people is that you actually
actively don't care about the

156
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:18,450
victim wellbeing of your
community. Okay, so how do you

157
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:23,100
get started on getting a code of
conduct? Well, you need to start

158
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,490
to think about what values you
want your community to have.

159
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,530
What kind of behaviors Would you
like to see in your community.

160
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,600
Also, think about how you want
to process an incident if

161
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,590
something should happen, and
what the consequences should be.

162
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,700
Last but not least, you as a
project leader, you will have to

163
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,820
accept that this is something
you have to deal with.

164
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,980
Humanity starts with culture, it
starts with you. And your

165
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,140
attitude towards these kinds of
things will permeate your

166
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:10,800
project and some takeaways at
the end. encourage those who

167
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,970
have have good practice in your
community. Those should follow

168
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:19,320
the follow the contribution
guidelines in a good way. Those

169
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:26,490
who help help build a good
community. Also, make sure to

170
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:33,150
interact with your community to
build these things. This will

171
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:40,740
help help ensure buy in from
your community members also set

172
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,910
up a process for how to how to
deal with current akoto called

173
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:54,090
own conduct issues. and
communicate these guides these

174
00:14:54,090 --> 00:15:00,900
processes clearly to your
community members. My last tip

175
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:06,930
is really, if you if at all
possible, don't write your own

176
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:12,750
code of conduct. Find a code of
conduct that you like and copy

177
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,900
and adapt that one because
committee Code of Conduct

178
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:20,100
documents can be quite
complicated to write. There are

179
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:27,360
a lot of facets to think about.
And that is it for me.
