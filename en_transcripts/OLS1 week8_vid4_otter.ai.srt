1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
Unknown: I'm very excited to be
here and talk a little bit about

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,960
open protocols. My name is Anita
potlucks, and I'm the head of

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,740
outreach at protocols that I O.
And I would like to start

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,950
actually with a little story.
And this is the story of Rocky

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,770
to scientist recruited here. And
he's very excited to have his

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,010
first day in a new lab. And he's
ready to plan this first

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,830
experiment. But because this is
something that he's never worked

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,860
with before, he needs to figure
out what he needs to do for his

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,430
first experiment. So he decides
to look at the lab notebook from

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,730
the previous post stock, but
unfortunately, turns out that

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,790
lab notebook is a paper lab
notebook. And nobody really

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,330
knows where it is. And it's
lost. So maybe the previous

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,530
poster took it with him or her
or it's somewhere but nobody

14
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,410
knows where it is. So he cannot
look at the lab notebook. So he

15
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,370
decides, oh, well, let me check
the papers. So he starts reading

16
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,390
publications, and he thinks he
will find the method description

17
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,230
in the publication. And the
publication says we did

18
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,310
reference 45 did. So he goes to
reference 45 publication that

19
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:08,010
says, we did put other stuff and
that publication. And he's like,

20
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,040
well, how did the others do it.
And then original publication

21
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,580
says, we did this with
conventional methods. And of

22
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,000
course, this is very
exaggerated. But not only rocky

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,730
has this problem. But
oftentimes, it's actually very,

24
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,810
very hard to repeat or build
upon previously published work.

25
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,530
And one of the reasons is often
the lack of detailed recipes

26
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,980
describing how the research and
experiments were performed. So I

27
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,950
think scientists can be really
better at describing what they

28
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,830
expect, what they actually did
for the experiments to make it

29
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,370
easier for others to reproduce
the work. And our mission and

30
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:45,450
protocols that I use to make it
easy for others to share method

31
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,720
details before, during and after
publication. Um, so protocols

32
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,800
that IO is an open access
repository for methods, we do

33
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,000
have about 6000 protocols on the
platform right now. And they are

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,460
on a large diversity of
disciplines. So we don't try to

35
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,700
limit ourselves to one specific
research field, we do welcome

36
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,840
all kinds of research protocols.
And yeah, all the methods are

37
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,510
open access, you don't need to
create an account or anything to

38
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,720
view the public content, you can
just come to the side search for

39
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,590
things and you'll see all the
public methods for that search

40
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,300
keywords that you're entering.
And the special thing about the

41
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,600
methods on protocols that I use
is that they're interactive and

42
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,900
dynamic protocols. So the
protocols are not static PDFs,

43
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,540
but they're interactive and
dynamic. And a couple of things

44
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,820
I want to highlight here. So
this is what the typical

45
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,580
protocols look like. So one,
you'll notice that every public

46
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,420
protocol gets a DUI. So it's
like a pool, you can include it

47
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,640
in your manuscript when you
publishing it, you can include

48
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,970
it in your sheet or submissive
section. And then another thing

49
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,180
is that we have a commenting
functionality. so others can

50
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,260
leave comments on your protocol,
unlike a protocol level, or also

51
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,720
on the step level. So if there's
like a specific step of your

52
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,510
protocol that was unclear or
maybe needed further

53
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,140
explanation, they can leave a
comment on a specific step. And

54
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,140
then the author and everybody
who's following this protocol

55
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,510
will get a notification about
any comment. And then the

56
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,860
discussion happens right there
under protocol. And then we also

57
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,920
want to so you can see here,
this one is actually version two

58
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,450
protocols. So we really want to
make it easy to always share

59
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,780
corrections and optimizations of
protocols. So if you publish a

60
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,410
protocol, and you keep working
on that method, with literally a

61
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,960
click of a button, you can click
new version, and you can create

62
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,630
a new version of your method.
And then everybody who's using

63
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,110
this method will be always
guided to the newest version. So

64
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,480
they'll get like a little pop up
that says there's a new version

65
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,210
of those protocols available,
would you like to see the

66
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,560
original version or the new
version, and then we also do

67
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,800
preserve all the older version.
So you can always go back and

68
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,620
see what changed between the
different versions. But we do

69
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,420
want to make it easy to update
protocols. And then also, the

70
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,360
protocols are entered in like an
easy to follow step by step

71
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,750
description. So you don't have
like a long hard to understand

72
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,830
text block. We do encourage
everybody to encourage step by

73
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,430
step in a step by step format.
And we also do have like a run

74
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,520
button on every protocol. So
when you're in the lab, ready to

75
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,550
follow protocol, you can use
this rattling functionality to

76
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:21,000
actually track your experiments,
you can check off every single

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,490
step, as you complete it,
everything gets the timestamp.

78
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,250
And then we have like an
electronic lab notebook record

79
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,040
kind of thing at the end of the
experiment run.

80
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,980
Yeah, to create a protocol on
protocols that IO, you do need

81
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,470
to create an account for that.
So for that you need to create

82
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,530
an account. But it's really
easy, you basically just click

83
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,710
new protocol and that brings it
to our critical editor. And in

84
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,270
the protocol editor has a bunch
of like regular text editing

85
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,150
tools, but we also do have like
all these components that you

86
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,870
can see on the on the right hand
side here that allows you to

87
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,780
just add all the details that
are necessary for others to

88
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,390
understand your protocol and
also there's like, for Simple if

89
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,210
you add like an amount component
that makes your protocol

90
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,760
scalable, or like a timer
component, and there's like

91
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,730
automatic timers that start when
you use the run functionality.

92
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,210
And there's like a lot of MATLAB
components here, but also

93
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,750
computational components, like
you can put your command lines,

94
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:21,330
and you can link a few data sets
and things like that. And then,

95
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,550
so every time you create a
protocol, it always starts out

96
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,820
private, you're the only person
who can see it. And then it's up

97
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,000
to you when you want to share it
with who. And you can either

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,060
share protocols privately with
others. So if you want to share

99
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,010
it with like close
collaborators, you can share it

100
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:38,670
privately first. Or if you are
ready to make it fully public,

101
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,740
you can click the Publish
button, and you can make it

102
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,640
fully public. And if you do make
it public, the protocol gets

103
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,090
gets a citation. So it just
keeps the DUI you can include it

104
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,870
in your manuscript editors can
cite it. And we do also archive

105
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,170
all the public protocols with
clocks to ensure long term

106
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:58,770
preservation. And then you as
the protocol owner, you can

107
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,560
always keep it up to date with
the versioning. And then we also

108
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,280
have something that we call
forks of protocol. so others can

109
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,550
take your protocol and kind of
create their own version of your

110
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,100
protocol. So if there's a couple
of things that they need to

111
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,310
tweak here and there to make it
fit for their needs, they can

112
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,710
take your protocol and create
their own version of your

113
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,550
protocol.

114
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,220
Yeah, but sharing methods is not
always easy. Two questions that

115
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:31,320
I hear a lot are, one, the
method was developed by someone

116
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,070
else can I share it? And the
other question is, when is the

117
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:38,250
right time to share the
protocols? Like I think we had

118
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,730
it before a little bit, but
like, what if somebody scoops me

119
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,490
yours, I think if I share too
early. So these are kind of the

120
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,190
two main questions. And
regarding the first question,

121
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:51,420
there's some very interesting
article for the US Copyright

122
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,970
Office, they have like a whole
kind of page on works that's not

123
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,670
protected by copyright. And I'm
not a lawyer or anything, so I

124
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,700
can not give any legal advice.
But it's very interesting that

125
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,610
they have like an entire section
on methods. So apparently,

126
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,840
methods themselves are not
protected by copyright. So if

127
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,760
you are publishing somebody
else's method, and you put that

128
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,310
person as an author,
technically, that's okay. And

129
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,970
with all the 6000 protocols that
we have on protocols, but I do

130
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:23,940
we never saw any trouble or any
issues with that. Also, like the

131
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,060
committee on publication ethics,
there's like this phrase that I

132
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,000
think is very interesting, it
says use of similar or identical

133
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,120
phrases and method sections,
where there are limited ways to

134
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,570
describe a common method,
however, it is not uncommon. So

135
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,840
I think it's really, like
oftentimes, we try to formulate

136
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,080
things in our papers like so it
sounds like something different.

137
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,360
And even though if you did the
same thing as somebody else,

138
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,840
like, I think it's really okay
to to see what he did and not

139
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,800
try to make it more complicated
than it already is. And I'm

140
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,850
protocols that I do, we do also
allow you to distinguish

141
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:03,540
between, excuse me, authors, and
context. So here, you can see,

142
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:07,470
um, this person was the author
for recipe, but another person

143
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,340
actually published it. And the
context person can always change

144
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,770
in our protocol. So if you
publish somebody else's

145
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,830
protocol, but you're not really
the author, but you can always

146
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,900
transfer the ownership off off
the protocol to somebody else.

147
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,820
So if you leave the lab and you
want to give it to somebody

148
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:28,140
else, that's totally okay. So we
do make that difference here.

149
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,600
Regarding when to share
protocol. And we do really leave

150
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,540
it up to the users when they
wanted to share protocol. And

151
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,390
when you're sharing, when you're
publishing a protocol, there's

152
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:44,040
one section where we ask you for
the status of a protocol. So you

153
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,700
can choose between working in
development or other. So you can

154
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,890
choose choose one of the three
and then you can also put the

155
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,980
details. So like whatever that
means for you. So you could say,

156
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,280
this is something we're still
hoping or even I see a lot of

157
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,610
not a lot, but some protocols
where people even say this to

158
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,590
something we tried, and it
didn't work. But here are two

159
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:05,040
methods that we use. So you can
even share things that didn't

160
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,600
work. So they're out there in
the community. So it's really up

161
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,070
to you when you want to share
protocols. And one thing that I

162
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,490
wanted to share was really
exciting about if all the

163
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:23,130
protocols are in one central
repository. I'm here somebody

164
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:27,630
that tweeted they were looking
for, um, for someone who has

165
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:32,280
experience doing RNA extraction
for neuron core, cortical neuron

166
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,090
cultures, and then there was
like a threat. And somebody

167
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,670
said, from all the ones on
protocols that I Oh, I think

168
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:43,800
this trisul protocol should work
for your purpose. And if you

169
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,640
look at where this protocol
actually came from, it's a

170
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:52,230
protocol for sticklebacks,
stickleback fish parasites, so

171
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,440
it has nothing to do with
cortical neuron cultures. Right?

172
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,710
And what I think is really
interesting here is that this

173
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,740
person probably would have never
Even found this protocol if it

174
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,090
wasn't in protocols that I owe,
and nothing is really cool that

175
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,690
you can even find methods that
might not be specifically from

176
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,230
your, from your field. But from
other fields, it could still be

177
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:21,570
helpful. And I'm coming up from
the time but there's a lot of

178
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,990
organizations, encouraging the
use of protocols that I owe

179
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:28,140
today that includes a lot of
journals and publishers, we have

180
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,840
more than 500 journals. Now that
added us to their author

181
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,260
guidelines. So they're
encouraging all the authors to

182
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:39,990
put protocols on protocols that
I owe. And then there's also a

183
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,630
lot of vendors that are
requiring or recommending

184
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,230
protocols that I owe in their
crank guidelines. And also more

185
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:51,210
and more institutions are
encouraging their researchers to

186
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,620
use protocols that I yo
