1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
Unknown: So I left the FM nasm
research, which is an open

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,350
research publishing platform. It
started in 2013. We publish a

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,160
range of research outputs all
over the life sciences and

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,300
biology, but also broader as
well as traditional research

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,040
articles, but also things like
no results, software tools, data

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,500
notes, things which hopefully
play in this home making

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,230
research more reproducible and
transparent. So we call

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,840
ourselves an open research
platform because it will

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,720
incorporate these things. The
first is that all articles are

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,940
public access. Secondly, we have
a quite strict Open Data policy

11
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,490
don't we endorse, the fair
guidelines are spoken about

12
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:52,350
earlier. And my Sorry, it's hard
to pin these little things going

13
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,730
about fairly similar with the
with dates of using cars, that

14
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,590
people open technologies and
make sense for people to use.

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,310
Again, with methods we have a
method article type that you can

16
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,550
use, but also in your research
article, basically show that the

17
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,480
method is detailed, something
come along and reproduce what

18
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,360
you've done. One I'm really
going to talk to you about today

19
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,040
is to compare every side of it.
And before I really get into it,

20
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,630
I need to sort of flag up a lot
of different things we publish

21
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:30,630
or someone else published an
open, systematic review, which

22
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,350
looked at how people discuss
open reviews. And I compare it

23
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,090
found there are 122 definitions
of open peer review. And these

24
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,250
22 distinct configurations of
seven traits, there's quite a

25
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,400
lot of different ways that you
can do a compare review. And you

26
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,490
always have to make sure you're
talking about the same open peer

27
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,300
review system. So these are the
seven traits. And I'm not gonna

28
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,240
go into all of them, because
I've only got 10 minutes, I'm

29
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,650
gonna focus on these three. So
open identities. This is the

30
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:05,160
idea that authors and reviewers
are aware of each other is open

31
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,280
reports, having the review
reports published alongside the

32
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,880
article for people to read. And
the third one is open pre review

33
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,460
manuscripts. These are
preprints. Essentially,

34
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,600
manuscripts are made immediately
available before any formal peer

35
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,530
review procedures. So these are
your bio archive met archives,

36
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,890
all the other archives, and also
is incorporated into our peer

37
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:32,280
review model as well. So this is
our peer review model. And it is

38
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,150
open pre review manuscripts,
open report open identities. So

39
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,000
when you submit an article to
us, it comes into our editorial

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,990
office, we do pre publication
checks, like ethics, plagiarism

41
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,500
is a data there are the methods
complete. And once we're happy

42
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,790
with it, and we send it to be
professionally typeset. Then

43
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,630
within about two weeks, it's
published online sites for the

44
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,800
Doa, indexed in Google Scholar.
And this this point is like the

45
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,890
preprint side of it, because
it's not been peer reviewed, but

46
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,280
it is available online. But you
wouldn't be able to submit it

47
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,420
anywhere else, because you have
committed to Apparently, the

48
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,910
publication of this article
triggers the peer review

49
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:16,500
process. So we invite referees,
most to agree to review the

50
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,790
article, have their name, their
affiliation, a status for their

51
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,670
report, and their report will
publish online as well. This is

52
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:29,040
the overall reports and identity
side of it. The officers can go

53
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,270
away submit a second version of
those articles that are based on

54
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,360
those reports from the
reviewers. And that second

55
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,030
version is published October 1.
So this is the loop that you can

56
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,380
see the open pair view and
article revision loop here. And

57
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,620
once that article was to receive
two approved statuses from the

58
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,040
reviewers, so two ticks, or one
approved and two approves with

59
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,060
revisions, so a tip into
question marks at that point,

60
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:59,190
it's past peer review. So it's
indexed in European cpmc. And

61
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,750
all those bibliographic
databases I want to take you

62
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,480
through so you can see a couple
of examples of how this works.

63
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,170
So this is an article which has
just been published is that the

64
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:14,430
preprint stage. So you can see
in the title, it says version

65
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,240
one awaiting peer review, that's
included in the citation so you

66
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,080
can see exactly what safeguards
that you know that it's not past

67
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,740
peer review stage. And over here
you can see the open peer review

68
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,440
box. That's where all the names
of the peer reviewers and their

69
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,700
comments will come up. This
articles had a peer review

70
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,550
comment, it's actually purchased
a second version has received

71
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,430
two approved and you can see
that the name the titles

72
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,520
updated, it says what version is
and what's happened with the

73
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,000
peer review.

74
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:48,000
The review report, you can see
the name of the affiliation, the

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,760
comments and behind my face
here. You can see that clip and

76
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,030
respond to the most how many
times invited. So this report

77
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,270
has a dry which means the
reviewer gets credit for Well

78
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,540
done. Because you do put a lot
of effort in when you do these

79
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,820
reports, it's nice to get
credit, you can add it to orchid

80
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,320
IDs, you'll see these things
like that. The whole idea of it

81
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,560
is really to create a nice
constructive dialogue between

82
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,710
the reviewer and the author with
both sides of the parties

83
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,970
standing by their comments. It's
very open and transparent. This

84
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,580
review reports got four people
on it, that's because it's been

85
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,480
co refereed. So this is really
good. If you have early career

86
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,000
researcher who's writing
reviews, and you want to get

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,450
credit for it. And you can ride
it with a more senior colleague,

88
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,450
or because maybe it's something
that you both need to work on,

89
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,550
you might have different
expertise, you can work together

90
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,210
as well. And you can see the
response from the author here.

91
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,290
So it's quite a collaborative
process and very transparent.

92
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,910
Once the articles come through
peer review, you can see here it

93
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,000
looks like with the two
versions, the version one had to

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,390
approve reservations, the
version twos got to approve up

95
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:01,170
to the referees have changed
their status from approved for

96
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:07,110
the patients to approve. So
hopefully, that's quite a quick

97
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,740
one. So you can see why open
peer review can be good. It

98
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,710
minimizes bias. So the reviews
have to stand by the comments.

99
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,130
And also the authors have to
stand by that responses if they

100
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:21,540
want to clarify anything they
can. And they don't have to

101
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,200
necessarily make everyone happy,
because everyone can see it all

102
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,680
the reviewer reports, it's also
really good information to have

103
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,710
turned anyway, having these
reports open because you can use

104
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,680
it in training if you want to
see how to write a good review

105
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,360
report and also not to write a
review report. And it's if

106
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,720
you're new to the field, and you
want to have a wider context of

107
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,330
that article, you can read those
reports to see what other people

108
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,930
think of it as well. As I
mentioned, the reviewers get

109
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,740
credit for it. And the last
comment is better written, I

110
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,140
realize I should definitely have
a citation here. But there is

111
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:59,400
some research to show that
review reports to open tend to

112
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,460
be better written than those
that are closed, see if I can

113
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:07,650
find a citation for that later.
And also, they've been talking a

114
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,990
lot about reproducibility. So
you have a lot of these

115
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,200
different article types, there
tends to be an overemphasis on

116
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,860
research articles, we publish a
lot of research output, so you

117
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,050
get credit for all these
different article types,

118
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,900
including our results and
reproducibility studies. And

119
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,500
this hopefully reduces research
ways to increase efficiencies.

120
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,750
So there isn't someone else out
there trying to do somewhere

121
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,990
that you know, is never gonna
work. There are two things I

122
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,930
quickly want to point out. The
first is study protocols,

123
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,660
because that's coming up later,
we publish them as well. And the

124
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,540
second one, which you can't see,
but it's registered reports.

125
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,190
Register report is basically a
protocol that's published and

126
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:48,720
peer reviewed prior to any data
being collected. So this enables

127
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,560
you to look at the rigor of the
method. And to ensure that the

128
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,580
research asked which is
published later, is linked back

129
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,790
to the best report and
everything they said in that

130
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,580
mesh report was followed, and
that the data justifies the

131
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,720
conclusions. So hopefully, this
is the end of the SMA line

132
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,920
slide. You can see the F 1000
research is quite open.

133
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,610
Hopefully it sort of increases
the transparency of the way that

134
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,340
research has been published.
It's really quick because we

135
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,920
combine the preprint process
with the peer review process.

136
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,670
And because we asked for the
data and software and also the

137
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:30,060
reports to be open is quite
reproducible. And so that's it.

138
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,760
Any questions? This is all my my
final slide.
