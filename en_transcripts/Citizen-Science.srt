1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
Unknown: I'm based in Paris
these days, I'm the director of

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,790
research for open humans
foundation here. And I'm based

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,480
at the Center for Research and
disciplinarity. Working on

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,420
citizen science at large, and
especially on how to use

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,780
personal data in citizen
science, but to get started

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,930
maybe a bit of what the
different types of citizen

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,960
science and I put it in the
scare quotes, because what we

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,750
very often see as a citizen
scientist asking people for

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,830
their money, which is very
unfortunate, because it makes

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,680
the whole idea of actually
contributing to a researcher but

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,910
at absurdum, then we have human
computation where humans put in

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,570
place for actually analyzing
images or videos, where machine

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,150
learning methods or any other
algorithms aren't good enough.

14
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,600
And of course, we have the idea
of using people in crowdsourcing

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,170
the data collection itself. And
this background of crowdsourcing

16
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,960
the data collection itself, I
personally started out with when

17
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,990
I started a project where people
donated their genetic data in

18
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,920
the public domain. But a bit of
the issues we see the research

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,650
cycle here are the different
stages. And I think, for me,

20
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:05,340
sharing in the sense of research
also means giving people a way

21
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,400
to share in doing research, and
not just in benefiting from the

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,750
outcomes. Unfortunately, having
the citizen science or community

23
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,330
science projects, which are
actually co created the super

24
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,150
rare, there was a survey about
European citizen science

25
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,200
projects last year, and co
created or not even 11% of other

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,160
projects. So it's pretty rare.
Most people use regular people

27
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,260
in their research for data
collection, which is

28
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,710
contributory or collaborative,
which has human computation

29
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,110
kinds of citizen science. So
this question of enabling co

30
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,320
creation is especially relevant
when it comes to citizen science

31
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,650
around health and well being
because often, as we discussed

32
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,290
earlier, and the answer is it's
about patient data, or

33
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,250
individuals that have diseases
or have some kinds of problems,

34
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,680
which they want to have softer,
where they actually are experts,

35
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,400
and especially when it comes to
chronic conditions, patients

36
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,160
very often are much more the
experts of their own disease

37
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,950
than any medical professional
could be just because they need

38
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,830
to deal with it. 24 seven
compared to a medical doctor, it

39
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:10,740
is only on a professional basis.
And my answer for how can we

40
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,560
enable co creation is the idea
of Commons based peer

41
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,650
production, which we see in open
source, which I think many of us

42
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,610
are familiar with even Wikipedia
even more, where the idea is

43
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,460
that it's very non hierarchical,
it's based on negotiated

44
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,220
coordination. So you have a very
flat hierarchy where people

45
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,800
actually need to talk to each
other, and no one can enforce

46
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,460
any rules easily. It's for
benefits or sharing is at the

47
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,070
center of all of it. And to
actually allow people to

48
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,890
participate, it needs to be
modular, small tasks where

49
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,100
people can contribute to based
on their own experience and

50
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,510
skill, which leads to this idea
of producer. So something that

51
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,850
parts of the Commons is
producing can be used to

52
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,490
generate more stuff and
knowledge in the commons at

53
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:55,050
large. And the question is, how
can we put this in the context

54
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,110
of using personal data for
citizen science and lots of

55
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,380
people are already using
personal data for their own surf

56
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,660
research, as I like to call it
and the quantified self

57
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,620
movement. Lots of people have
wearable devices, everyone uses

58
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,490
Google's social media, maybe
even get their genome analyzed

59
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:16,020
from 23andme at all. And so I'm
working on this project called

60
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,920
Open humans, which is a way for
using your data for doing

61
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,340
citizen science. And the idea
really, is that what we allow

62
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,610
people to do is aggregate their
data. So if you come to open

63
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,390
humans as an individual, you can
import data from basically all

64
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,440
of the sources I've mentioned,
that can be wearables, Google

65
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,930
searches to is actually one of
the projects which you can

66
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,810
import, if you trust us enough
to store your Google search

67
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,110
history. Mine actually is under
open humans, but it's private,

68
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,520
not public. So you can store all
of this data privately in your

69
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,730
account. And as I said, there's
tons of different sources. So we

70
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,510
have, for example, another thing
that actually patients will just

71
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,840
importing glucose monitoring
data and the Type One Diabetes

72
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,330
community everyone, there's
varying continuous glucose

73
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,320
monitors. So people import real
time 24, seven data of their

74
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,480
glucose levels, which they then
want to use for research

75
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,470
purposes. And once you've done
this, you can actually start on

76
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,140
an individual level to do
citizen science on the end of

77
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,260
one just by yourself if you want
for this in open humans, we have

78
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,830
this little trip perhaps set up
where you can read data analysis

79
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:22,770
notebooks, which you can share
with others. So we have this

80
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,770
public collection of lots of
different data analysis tools,

81
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,320
which use different data
sources, and you can just look

82
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,500
at them. And if you click on any
of them, you can open up and run

83
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,560
this analysis using your
personal data because the data

84
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,580
is centralized in open human so
you can just reuse notebooks and

85
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,270
reproduce analysis on your own
data instead of using mine, for

86
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:48,480
example. And just to give a few
examples of this one, but it's a

87
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,940
funny one, which uses
productivity tracking data,

88
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,270
which I

89
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,210
have collected over the years
along with my variable device

90
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,270
data. And what you can see on
the right is this very strong

91
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,450
correlation between how many
hours I spent on the Xbox In

92
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,020
front of my computer using my
computer, compared to how much

93
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,370
physical activity I get it 2017
is the year I was writing my PhD

94
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,880
thesis. So you see lots and lots
of our players were spent long

95
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,030
hours in the office writing my
PhD, but I didn't do any

96
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,480
physical activity. And you could
even correlate this as well with

97
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,080
my smartscape to see how my wage
increase because I was just

98
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,100
working and not doing anything
else. And we just mentioned

99
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,220
earlier, the whole issue about
the current situation, we just

100
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,820
had a community called Open
humans, I think yesterday, and

101
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,580
started this little quantified
flu project to see whether we

102
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,510
can use wearable device data to
predict when someone might fall

103
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,960
just based on the physiological
signals like heart rate, body

104
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,140
temperature, and so on before
they exhibit any conscious

105
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,560
symptoms. And we made like an
output for this today, actually,

106
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:54,150
which is here, for two incidents
where a person was sick, which

107
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,880
is the red vertical line, which
tells you that they actually

108
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,360
transect and on the y axis you
have the body temperature. And

109
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,360
you see even like a bit before
people notice that actually know

110
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,640
that gets sick that there's
already an increase in the body

111
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,550
temperature, which you can use
in the data people already

112
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:13,440
routinely collect on stuffs in
any case. And we are expanding

113
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,490
on this idea a bit right now
with this King's Memorial on

114
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:22,770
self research, Stephen Keating
passed away I think, a bit less

115
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,460
than a year ago from a brain
tumor. And he was a member of

116
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,710
our board with the open humans
foundation. And he was the

117
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:33,180
biggest data share about
personal data. He got his cancer

118
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,230
genome sequences, regular genome
sequence, he got 3d models of

119
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:42,000
this brain tumor get like a 15
hour video of his own life awake

120
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,180
brain surgery, because you need
to stay awake. So they know when

121
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,180
they have removed for attaching
benefits, you actually should

122
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,120
keep in mind sort of just
removing humor. And he released

123
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,940
all of this data publicly and
said, Please use my data and

124
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,900
somehow to research on this. And
inspired from this, we are now

125
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,080
doing a project where we have I
think around 80 people enrolled

126
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,810
to do individual research
projects around their own

127
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,050
interests. And we have different
patient groups, we have people

128
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,360
who have no disease at all,
they're just interested in

129
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,120
learning about themselves. And
it's inspiring people to do

130
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,660
research by themselves. But the
more interesting part, of

131
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,240
course, for many of us here, I
think is the part where you

132
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,300
share data with academic or
community driven projects for

133
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:26,100
use in citizen science. And for
these also, there's lots of lots

134
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,160
of projects here already have
some are led by academics like

135
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,720
the keeping pace, one at NYU,
about using wearable devices to

136
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,160
understand seasonal patterns and
physical activity. We also have

137
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,330
some which are led by patient
communities, which I think I

138
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,940
don't see it on the slide up to
the right, the nightscout Data

139
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,540
Commons is like a patient group
of type one diabetes patients

140
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,790
and they are collecting all the
data, they're already feeding

141
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:53,610
into the system to do their own
research projects to understand

142
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,670
how they can optimize, for
example, their insulin usage,

143
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,730
which diet helps them to
minimize insulin use, especially

144
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,430
in countries like the US where
it's prohibitively expensive to

145
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:07,410
use insulin. And just to give
one very concrete example, this

146
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,620
is the patient driven research
project around cluster headaches

147
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,230
called no bism. But started by a
couple of cluster headache

148
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:17,730
patients in the Netherlands, and
cluster headaches. It's like the

149
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,430
worst form of migraines, which
are also called switch side

150
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,470
headaches, because people
actually end up killing

151
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,960
themselves just like their
headache attack stuff. So it's

152
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,740
really terrible. It's not really
even rare. It's about as rare as

153
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,620
multiple sclerosis, but they
only get around 1% of the

154
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,440
research funding compared to
multiple sclerosis. So there's

155
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:38,370
very little academic research by
being rather common. So they

156
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,400
started making their own
application for collecting data

157
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,280
on when do they have their text,
what might be potential

158
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,790
triggers? And what interventions
are they doing. The example here

159
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,420
on the screenshot is microdosing
magic mushrooms, because many of

160
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,600
them are in the Netherlands. And
you can get magic magic

161
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,070
mushrooms illegally. And so they
collect this data, individually

162
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,980
the storage and open Yuan sister
data store and then share the

163
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,710
state of for example, what they
are doing is they collaborate

164
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,320
with the Code Academy because
the patients themselves don't

165
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,860
have the expertise in analyzing
the data. So they reached out to

166
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,130
data science students at this
Code Academy to actually get the

167
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:18,030
students to learn data science
on real world actual data. And

168
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,790
in return, they get back the
university students do which

169
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:24,750
they otherwise would not be able
to do. And in return the status

170
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:30,420
also use them for donating to
advocacy and outreach purposes,

171
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:37,350
for example. So the last thing,
of course, doing this is it's a

172
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,230
matter of governance. So how can
you build trust of your

173
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,750
participants into a citizen
science and how can you build a

174
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:47,820
community and what we've tried
to do is be very open about all

175
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,340
parts of hardware. So we are
completely open source.

176
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,190
Everything is visible to
everyone except for the personal

177
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,910
data. But this includes the
governance as well. So the first

178
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,640
thing we are doing is every
single project you want to run

179
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,450
an open Humans, you need to ask
for permission from the

180
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:07,140
community to actually set up
Life. And here's an example of a

181
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,840
interesting study that one
individual did. She was doing

182
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,190
this a psycho, fun research
project. And she wants to study

183
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,070
whether there's any genetic
associations to Myers Briggs

184
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,610
personality types. So she posted
like, I have this project I

185
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,900
would like, like to run it on
open humans on the forum, which

186
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,450
then contains all the
description and she even got IRB

187
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,970
approval. So she gave
documentation for this as well

188
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,060
and everything. But then the
community was kind of split.

189
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,520
Some people were like, yep,
let's IRB approved, it's

190
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,030
completely fine. We should allow
this project to run and someone

191
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,510
else was like, are you basically
crazy, this is pretty much like

192
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,940
pop psychology doing Myers
Briggs, and there will be

193
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,610
nothing out there that's
actually useful that we can

194
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,780
learn from using this data. And
the community talked for, for

195
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,350
quite a bit about this to figure
out how to solve it. And in the

196
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,170
end to agree that open humans
has infrastructure, because

197
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,870
there's no harm in taking your
personality test, and that you

198
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,570
will never get any jeebus
results, it's fine to run it.

199
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,360
But the community discusses and
actually discusses with the

200
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,030
person running the project to
figure out what the consensus

201
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:12,900
might be and without consensus
projects can launch. The second

202
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,500
bit of governance is that open
humans run by a nonprofit

203
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,100
foundation based in the US. And
our borders are actually at

204
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,850
least 1/3 elected directly from
every member. So if you go to

205
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,910
the open humans website, and you
click an account, you are now

206
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,060
eligible to vote in the next
board election and decide who is

207
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,180
even officially in charge of
running the foundation on your

208
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:36,780
behalf. And the community
members can nominate themselves

209
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,990
to run the service will actually
start I think next week, because

210
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,260
we have three open board seats
coming up. So we will have

211
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:47,070
people in nominating themselves
and then voting just online for

212
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:53,040
their favorite candidates. So to
set up so citizen science in our

213
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,610
case really means allowing
people to use their own data and

214
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,310
making informed decision of how
to use this data. And I think

215
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,830
it's going back to the questions
we had earlier. It's like

216
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,800
informed consent. We are trying
to do the sort of citizen

217
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,710
science setting more than in the
academic research setting, we're

218
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,590
actually people are in both
making all the decisions and not

219
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:14,280
just signing a consent form at
the end. And this allows both

220
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,780
academic and patient projects to
run. And what's really important

221
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,840
in citizen sciences make people
play an active role in the

222
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,350
governance as much as you can,
and this is of interest. We have

223
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,760
an open select which you can
join
