1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Unknown: Let's just get into
open education and really, open

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,320
education encompasses
everything, resources to

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,700
practices. But I play a
framework of open sharing. So

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,480
when you get to those all the
tools that facilitate the

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:27,090
sharing of resources sharing the
application for access

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:33,420
worldwide, is the main concept
of framework around open. Is it

7
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:41,040
audible? You, you have a bit of
a background noise, but if an

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,180
echo but we can hear you.

9
00:00:51,810 --> 00:01:01,410
So open educational resources,
which is now the materials for

10
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,850
the conduct of slides, training
materials curricula, that has

11
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:13,020
been shared openly must be
talking about credibility,

12
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,490
accessibility, interoperability,
and reusability. And I'll focus

13
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:23,010
more on the concept of
reusability, which, if you make

14
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,420
resources available online, make
your slides available online

15
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,930
curricula available online. That
is not really open educational

16
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,100
resources, unless there is a
license that allows us to be

17
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,430
able to make use of that
resource, we motivate people to

18
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:45,090
share to adopt it for the kids,
that's really important for open

19
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,800
educational resources. So when
it comes to open sense, a

20
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,250
community of scientists that
mostly by politicians that came

21
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,240
together to promote Open Science
within the bioinformatics

22
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,380
community, and the main premise
for this is that you can really

23
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,130
be an efficient scientist, when
you are near collaborators are

24
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,990
not aware, and equipped with
open sales tools. So you know,

25
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,800
as much as you could be well
equipped yourself with common

26
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,450
sense to have the benefits of
science, as a scientist, you

27
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,840
don't work in a silo, you need
to collaborate with other

28
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,720
scientists. But then if your
collaborators are not equipped,

29
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,130
then you will not be able to
make the full use of the power

30
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:38,520
of open science as a whole. And
that's why within the open sense

31
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:44,550
key, we had a model, which will
sensitize us sensitize your

32
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,750
community whereby you make them
aware of the benefits, what's

33
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,900
available out there that they
can make use of, to make them

34
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,050
better scientists to make them
more efficient with a more

35
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,290
productive dimension. Every
study is reproducible, useful,

36
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,280
direct community, and without we
use the model of seminars,

37
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,880
various universities, research
institutions, and then after

38
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,560
that now, having met them aware,
the concept of training, equip

39
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,880
them with the tools, and that's
where workshops are important.

40
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:23,010
Having done that, to be able to
solidify those caves and Dr.

41
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:27,060
Liquid open sense and practice
these hacking like coming

42
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,500
together to work together to
collaborate with somebody, this

43
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,440
is really important to be able
to see open scientific practice

44
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,340
to be able to see what you've
trained them in, in practice.

45
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,090
After that, now the
collaborative aspect, so these

46
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:51,600
are not Sprint's useful here for
the collaborative, to be writing

47
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,990
to be put to the wayside and so
forth. And the main thing in

48
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,950
theory is that build a community
around that, to learn from each

49
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,970
other for to working together. I
think that's what open license

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,440
is also also being models of
justice. So this was during one

51
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,480
of our campaigns, which we are
the letter B. And so within the

52
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,380
hackathon, you will see we had
the hackers and we had a number

53
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:25,410
of projects we have three
projects but various with

54
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,240
various said today as well. So
one other project would be just

55
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,830
understand what's the open
census to begin with our daily

56
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,400
data mining all the templates
published by authors and be able

57
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,100
to figure out our they
collaborate. they collaborate

58
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,400
internally or externally when it
comes to making use of

59
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:50,370
preprints. our day to day visit
driven by the local researchers

60
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:54,630
or by their collaborators. And
looking at the Open Sans face.

61
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:59,790
You could see this agenda prior
to us being more open which was

62
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:15,210
To the collaborative work all of
them. So I'll move to other open

63
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,780
educational resources are
available. I'll talk about the

64
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,680
pathological left of the by
informatics training within the

65
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:29,430
s3 Africa consortia. So, within
that consortia, they raise the

66
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,950
use of a blend and money
approach whereby all the

67
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:39,570
materials available and then the
lectures are pre recorded by the

68
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:45,360
lecturers or the trainers. And
then they are shared on wood to

69
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,740
the local classrooms, which
which have a look at, say,

70
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,440
teaching assistants. So, the
teaching assistants would

71
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,840
facilitate in class training and
learning, under trainers will be

72
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,140
available online to train. So,
the blended learning approach,

73
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:06,810
of course, ensure that, even if
the internet may not be stable,

74
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,210
they can still and could still
continue, and they are number of

75
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:13,020
training activities. And what's
really nice is that we

76
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:18,150
introduced the modular and open
science is coming to study in

77
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,630
late. So it is really, really
cool. And we have also received

78
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,800
training as well. And within
that all those we make use of

79
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,800
open educational resources, we
encouraging all trainers to put

80
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,060
their resources on GitHub, we
create a report for each of the

81
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:40,020
modules. But just going to ask
my number of questions that I

82
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,530
keep reflecting on most of my
projects are some of the

83
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,350
discussions and we look at
bioinformatics is an

84
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:52,110
interdisciplinary course. But
then, how do we strike a

85
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,140
collaboration between computer
science and biomedical research

86
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:59,340
as the weakness that I've
observed within my country by

87
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,030
majority of the bioinformatics
consider biologists come from a

88
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:07,830
biomedical background, and very
few, very few actually would

89
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:12,450
come from the bio, the computer
science field always spike that

90
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,900
collaboration. And you can see
there is lack of shared tools,

91
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,930
the computer scientists, they
have different tools that

92
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,530
balances the tools, we need to
be able to bridge that gap. And

93
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,950
then training curricula to
ensure it meets current research

94
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:30,630
recently is building a curricula
that is useful and also within

95
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:35,550
the bio net we creating some of
those curricula which are being

96
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:41,010
adapted to the various
institutions with Africa. Then,

97
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,330
what does open science mean for
those African researchers can

98
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:50,370
already be sure what is the
important question to answer
