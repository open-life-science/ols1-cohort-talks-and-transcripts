1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,970
Unknown: I will talk now about
road mapping for open project.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:09,660
And that's wrong one. So what we
will do is what we will see how

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,380
we can use a road map to plan
your walk in contribution for a

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,130
project for your project for
your project, and look at some

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,290
examples, and do during at the
end of the course, we will give

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,890
you an assignment to create or
revise your, your roadmap for

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,420
your project. But I will first
introduce you to the roadmap.

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,520
So, same as you mentioned, so,
it's the same introduction to

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,870
open EDA design and build
project that empower others to

10
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,710
collaborate. And I will talk a
bit now about the collaboration

11
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,890
part and our the roadmap can
help you to empower others to

12
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,480
collaborate within inclusive
communities to your project.

13
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,570
Again, with nice tables of
designing, building and pouring

14
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,740
and for understanding sharing
and participation. And now with

15
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,960
the roadmap will focus on this
the part on the top right,

16
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,700
participation and inclusion. So
how you design your project to

17
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:19,200
add participation and
inclusions. So the idea is to to

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,680
develop a welcoming space that
make a good first impression

19
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,520
that you you are new
contributors are in the right

20
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,270
place to contribute that they
feel welcome. And that they can

21
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,490
be they can get involved in one
project. But for that you let

22
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,850
you need to let them know what's
going on what's happening, what,

23
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:43,230
what is the current status of a
project, what you what you as a

24
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,250
leader of a project, you want to
what is your vision, so you

25
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,630
already write your visions, that
you can detail it a bit more

26
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:57,540
with the roadmap. And so a
roadmap will be a summary of a

27
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,190
project welcoming people to
contribute welcoming people, and

28
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,420
how they can get involved. And
usually you have a timeline. So

29
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,130
it's a three main main parts in
the roadmap, these three parts.

30
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,760
The first part of the project
summary and welcome will make

31
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,210
people we are welcome people
orient people to your to your

32
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,240
project. So usually there has
been linked to your map

33
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,630
directly. So they never maybe
never heard about your project.

34
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,990
They they went directly to your
roadmap. So it's important to

35
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,740
end them understanding where
they are, what is your project?

36
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,450
What is it about what is your
visions, and that they

37
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:44,400
understand their vision, their
the big idea about the project.

38
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,370
And to give them a clear focus,
it also helps you to give a

39
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,010
focus when writing the rest of
the roadmap, if you already

40
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:58,230
wrote write the visions. So the
project summary first is the

41
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,940
first thing that you will have
in your roadmap. And then the

42
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,060
second step is out to get
involved. So some new

43
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,840
contributors may want to just
jump right away, they want to

44
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,830
contribute directly. But though,
then you need to point them were

45
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,500
out to some documentations to
how they can contribute. Maybe

46
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:25,290
you have some easy to contribute
issues or something, it's

47
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,670
important to do that in your in
your in your roadmap, you will

48
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,390
need to do that too, to tell
them how they can get involved.

49
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,980
and point them to important part
two, the different part of your

50
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:43,650
project. The third part and the
more the more important part of

51
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,840
your roadmap will be the
timeline. So you need to

52
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,500
organize tasks to complete your
project around different

53
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,660
milestones and that it will map
what you are working on and what

54
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,140
is going next. So what is your
currently tasks that you need to

55
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,940
achieve what end what is your
visions, maybe on short term,

56
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:10,770
meters and long term. And so you
define different milestones that

57
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,110
can be turning point a
significant turning point or

58
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,380
event that we move your your
project for what it can be

59
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,320
statues. So for example, you
have a feature release plan, you

60
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,480
have a minimal, minimal viable
product that you want to

61
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,360
release. It can be also an
event. So for example, you

62
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,940
organize a hackathon and you
have different milestones you

63
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,210
want to achieve these things
before the hackathon or during

64
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:38,100
the hackathon or you have a
deadline for submission of a

65
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,400
paper somewhere or for
conference for example, and you

66
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,480
want to achieve things before it
can be sorts of timeframe. So as

67
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:51,210
I mentioned, oh, there is a
mistakes. And beside the

68
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,990
timeframe, the short time is a
short term, medium term and long

69
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:55,470
terms.

70
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,360
frame for your project. So it's
important to when you write

71
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,300
your, you're going to have to
pick 123 milestones for your

72
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,650
timeline. And then once you have
them, you can list some tasks to

73
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,380
complete for each of the
milestones that will include

74
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,920
information to make to help
people to contribute to know

75
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,890
what has to be done, what will
be successful, what will be a

76
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:30,000
successful fifth tasks out
should look like how you can get

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,480
started. So maybe point to some
documentation or some part of

78
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,980
your code to say, Okay, how can
I do that, and why this task is

79
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:42,210
important. So on finalize that
to make sure that you relate

80
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:48,270
that to your vision. And the
question is how you can share

81
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:52,440
now this will map how you store
your roadmap. And we were

82
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,650
discussing quickly with my
weekend, you're in the beginning

83
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:00,870
of the course. And that's, and
it's moving quite short, it's

84
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,490
changing a lot. So the way you
can do it is before I will say,

85
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,120
until recently, it was you have
a separate file called

86
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,170
roadmap.md. And if you go to
this link, they're open

87
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,530
discovery. I don't know if I
can, Oh, do you see my screen?

88
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:21,360
If I open it? Nope. Still your
slides. Okay, sorry. So you can

89
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,220
go through the links later. But
you can store in a roadmap find

90
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,120
attendee for Zeppelin, if you
have a GitHub repository, where

91
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,440
you storing this remap, then
that people can find later, you

92
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,610
can also put that in the readme
file. But I must admit that I

93
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,580
didn't find a good example,
recent example up to date

94
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,540
example of a readme file with a
roadmap inside, because

95
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:49,320
nowadays, I would say most of
the people use an issue. So you

96
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,190
have an issue too, with a
roadmap, for example, for the

97
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:57,720
open life science applications.
So I think it was Yeah, when we

98
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:03,360
saw in for the last trimester.
So we have this roadmap, what we

99
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,770
need to do for the applications
for our program here. And we

100
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:12,240
wrote a roadmap for that. But
also, if you're using GitHub to

101
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:17,820
for your project, you have this
nice project tabs in GitHub. And

102
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,990
that is you can see in the top
of your of the project, which is

103
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:26,100
really nice to organize your
roadmap there. For example, the

104
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,390
galaxy project, they use that
and it's quite powerful, because

105
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,970
you can really move things
forward. In the end, it's

106
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,390
totally open so people can see
it. But then you need to be sure

107
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:47,760
that your vision and things are
clear before and I was it was

108
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,550
just a global overview of what
is a roadmap, I will recommend

109
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:54,510
you to go through the different
the different examples that I

110
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,870
show you because they are
they're quite okay. quite nice.

111
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:03,600
And and to try to draft your
roadmap for your project. It

112
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,370
doesn't have to be a final one.
It's just a first version of

113
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:13,800
your offshore roadmap. And it
will help you to know what you

114
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,970
want to do and which steps you
want to achieve. And also the

115
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:23,730
timing for that. And yeah, when
coming new contributors, and on

116
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:27,120
that, I would like to thank you
for listening for that. And to

117
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,430
that. And yeah, again, sharing
the same idea of our programs

118
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,530
and Yep, thank you.
